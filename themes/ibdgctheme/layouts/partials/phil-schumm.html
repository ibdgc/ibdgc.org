        <p class="white-text">Phil Schumm is a statistician in the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of Chicago, where he also directs the department’s Research Computing Group. He has been involved with the Data Coordinating Center for the IBDGC since its inception in 2002 for which he assists Dr. Cho with the collection, management and distribution of the Consortium’s data. Over the last year Phil has been building a Data Commons to provide a permanent cloud-based repository for the Consortium’s data and those of the International IBD Genetics Consortium, as well as an environment for collaborative, reproducible computation over the data. He has also been working to develop data products for the Consortium’s ongoing longitudinal study of patients with Crohn’s disease following ileal resection surgery, and is excited about contributing to the analysis of those data. Phil’s own research interests are in the area of health and aging, where he has been developing new methods for the measurement and analysis of health that can be administered in population-based studies, including measures of sensory function, cognition and physical activity and sleep using accelerometry. He is a co-investigator for the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project (an NIA-funded U.S. national longitudinal study of health among adults aged 50 and older), and is part of a team studying factors associated with diabetic transitions. He also co-leads (with Robert Grossman) the Data and Analytic Support Core (DASC) for the Methodology and Advanced Analytics Resource Center of the Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (JCOIN), part of NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative.</p>
