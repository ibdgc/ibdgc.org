abstract: 'BACKGROUND: There has been considerable progress in identifying inflammatory
  bowel disease [IBD] susceptibility genes but little progress in examining the role
  of genetic variation in the development of the extra-intestinal manifestations [EIMs]
  of IBD. This study identified clinical, serological, and genetic factors associated
  with ocular EIMs [O-EIMs] in IBD. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case-control
  study of IBD patients, comparing those with and without O-EIMs using the Cedars-Sinai
  IBD Research Repository and the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium Repository. Genotyping
  was performed using Illumina whole genome platforms. RESULTS: In all, 124 cases
  and 3328 controls with available clinical data were identified; 103 cases and 2808
  controls had genetic data available. Erythema nodosum and peripheral arthritis particularly
  were common in patients with O-EIMs [p = 2.77 x 10(-13) and p = 2.58 x 10(-13),
  respectively] with increasing odds ratios for O-EIMs with each additional non-ocular-EIM
  [for ≥ 2 EIMs, odds ratio 14.72]. Nominal association with O-EIMs was observed at
  several known IBD susceptibility single nuclear polymorphisms. One locus, containing
  RBM19, achieved genome-wide level of significance for association with O-EIMs. CONCLUSIONS:
  In IBD, O-EIMs co-occur with musculoskeletal and skin manifestations and, in this
  study, are nominally associated with known IBD loci. Additional cohorts are needed
  to verify these results and identify additional genes.'
