abstract: "Abstract Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic digestive tract inflammatory conditions whose genetic etiology is still poorly understood. The incidence of IBD is particularly high among Ashkenazi Jews. Here, we identify 8 novel and plausible IBD-causing genes from the exomes of 4453 genetically identified Ashkenazi Jewish IBD cases (1734) and controls (2719). Various biological pathway analyses are performed, along with bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, to demonstrate the likely physiological relatedness of the novel genes to IBD. Importantly, we demonstrate that the rare and high impact genetic architecture of Ashkenazi Jewish adult IBD displays significant overlap with very early onset-IBD genetics. Moreover, by performing biobank phenome-wide analyses, we find that IBD genes have pleiotropic effects that involve other immune responses. Finally, we show that polygenic risk score analyses based on genome-wide high impact variants have high power to predict IBD susceptibility."
