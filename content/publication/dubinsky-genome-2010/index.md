abstract: "BACKGROUND: Interindividual variation in response to anti-TNFalpha therapy\
  \ may be explained by genetic variability in disease pathogenesis or mechanism of\
  \ action. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in inflammatory bowel disease\
  \ (IBD) have increased our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to IBD. The\
  \ aim was to test associations of known IBD susceptibility loci and novel \\\"pharmacogenetic\\\
  \" GWAS identified loci with primary nonresponse to anti-TNFalpha in pediatric IBD\
  \ patients and develop a predictive model of primary nonresponse. METHODS: Primary\
  \ nonresponse was defined using the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) for Crohn's disease\
  \ (CD) and partial Mayo score for ulcerative colitis (UC). Genotyping was performed\
  \ using the Illumina Infinium platform. Chi-square analysis tested associations\
  \ of phenotype and genotype with primary nonresponse. Genetic associations were\
  \ identified by testing known IBD susceptibility loci and by performing a GWAS for\
  \ primary nonresponse. Stepwise multiple logistic regression was performed to build\
  \ predictive models. RESULTS: Nonresponse occurred in 22 of 94 subjects. Six known\
  \ susceptibility loci were associated with primary nonresponse (P textless 0.05).\
  \ Only the 21q22.2/BRWDI loci remained significant in the predictive model. The\
  \ most predictive model included 3 novel \\\"pharmacogenetic\\\" GWAS loci, the\
  \ previously identified BRWD1, pANCA, and a UC diagnosis (R(2) = 0.82 and area under\
  \ the curve [AUC] = 0.98%). The relative risk of nonresponse increased 15-fold when\
  \ number of risk factors increased from 0-2 to textgreater or =3. CONCLUSIONS: The\
  \ combination of phenotype and genotype is most predictive of primary nonresponse\
  \ to anti-TNFalpha in pediatric IBD. Defining predictors of response to anti-TNFalpha\
  \ may allow the identification of patients who will not benefit from this class\
  \ of therapy."
