The Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Genetics Consortium is currently recruiting patients with IBD to participate in research studies. We are especially interested in individuals who are members of racial or ethnic minorities or who are undergoing an ileal resection for Crohn's disease. If you are in one of these groups and would like more information about participating in a Consortium study, please contact us at cholabIBD@mssm.edu.

### FAQ For Patients Undergoing Ileocolic Resection

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is a Research Study?</strong></summary>

A research study is when scientists try to answer a question about something
that we don’t know enough about. You can also agree to take part now and later
change your mind.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is the purpose of this Research Study?</strong></summary>

You may qualify to take part in this research study because you have been
diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, and will undergo or very recently underwent
ileal resection surgery.

The purpose of this study is gain further understanding of the mechanisms
involved in the recurrence of inflammation following ileal resection surgery
for Crohn’s disease (CD). One of the most common locations of CD involvement
is the end of the small intestine (ileum)[^1]. Reasons for this recurrence remain
unclear, however several studies have concluded that smoking increases the
risk of postoperative recurrence[^2]<sup>,</sup>[^3]<sup>,</sup>[^4]<sup>,</sup>[^5]<sup>,</sup>[^6]<sup>,</sup>[^7].
Postoperative recurrence is also believed to be caused by an interaction of
genetic[^8], immune and microbial features. There are also many unanswered
questions regarding the optimal management of patients during the
post-operative period with regards to medication, diet and frequency of
postoperative monitoring. This study aims to better understand the role of
genetics, immune system, environment, medication, smoking and diet in the
recurrence of Crohn’s disease after your surgery. We hope that our findings
will help your physician better optimize your medication and care. This study
is ongoing in several sites across the United States and Canada. We have
recruited about 500 participants.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is classified as recurrence and remission?</strong></summary>

Recurrence can either be histological (inflammation is only visible through a
microscope), endoscopic (inflammation is visible to your doctor during
endoscopy), clinical (you will have increased Crohn’s disease symptoms) or
Surgical (your symptoms are severe enough for surgery). Remission is defined
as the temporary absence of active disease. Remission can either be endoscopic
(no evidence of inflammation during your endoscopy) or clinical (you may have
reduced or no symptoms).
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is involved in participation?</strong></summary>

If you agree to participate in this study, you will be asked to provide a few
extra biopsies during your colonoscopy, we would draw some blood and ask you
some questions about your Crohn’s Disease medical history. You may also be
asked to provide stool samples. You may also be contacted by our partners at
Penn State if you express interest in the diet component of the study.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What do we do with your samples?</strong></summary>

Some of the blood we collect will be used for protein expression analysis,
some will be used for Whole Exome Sequencing in collaboration with the Broad
Institute. The biopsies we collect will be used to measure gene expression
analysis.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Will I receive results back?</strong></summary>

We will deidentify your data, so any information we collect from you cannot be
linked back to you and because of this, we will not be able to give you any
results. When the study is over and our results are published, you will be
able to read about our findings.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Where can I get more information?</strong></summary>

You can find additional resources at the [Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation](https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/).
