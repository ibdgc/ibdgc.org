abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a heterogeneous group
  of conditions unified by the presence of chronic childhood arthritis without an
  identifiable cause. Systemic JIA (sJIA) is a rare form of JIA characterised by systemic
  inflammation. sJIA is distinguished from other forms of JIA by unique clinical features
  and treatment responses that are similar to autoinflammatory diseases. However,
  approximately half of children with sJIA develop destructive,  long-standing arthritis
  that appears similar to other forms of JIA. Using genomic approaches, we sought
  to gain novel insights into the pathophysiology of sJIA and its relationship with
  other forms of JIA. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study of 770
  children with sJIA collected in nine countries by the International Childhood Arthritis
  Genetics Consortium. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were tested for association
  with sJIA. Weighted genetic risk scores were used to compare the genetic architecture
  of sJIA with other JIA subtypes. RESULTS: The major histocompatibility complex locus
  and a locus on chromosome 1 each showed association with sJIA exceeding the threshold
  for genome-wide significance, while 23 other novel loci were suggestive of association
  with sJIA. Using a combination of genetic and statistical approaches, we found no
  evidence of shared genetic architecture between sJIA and other common JIA subtypes.
  CONCLUSIONS: The lack of shared genetic risk factors between sJIA and other JIA
  subtypes supports the hypothesis that sJIA is a unique disease process and argues
  for a different classification framework. Research to improve sJIA therapy should
  target its unique genetics and specific pathophysiological pathways.'
