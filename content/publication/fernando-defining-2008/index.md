abstract: The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is one of the most extensively
  studied regions in the human genome because of the association of variants at this
  locus with autoimmune, infectious, and inflammatory diseases. However, identification
  of causal variants within the MHC for the majority of these diseases has remained
  difficult due to the great variability and extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD)
  that exists among alleles throughout this locus, coupled with inadequate study design
  whereby only a limited subset of about 20 from a total of approximately 250 genes
  have been studied in small cohorts of predominantly European origin. We have performed
  a review and pooled analysis of the past 30 years of research on the role of the
  MHC in six genetically complex disease traits - multiple sclerosis (MS), type 1
  diabetes (T1D), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's
  disease (CD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) - in order to consolidate and evaluate
  the current literature regarding MHC genetics in these common autoimmune and inflammatory
  diseases. We corroborate established MHC disease associations and identify predisposing
  variants that previously have not been appreciated. Furthermore, we find a number
  of interesting commonalities and differences across diseases that implicate both
  general and disease-specific pathogenetic mechanisms in autoimmunity.
