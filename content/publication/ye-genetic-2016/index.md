abstract: Epidemiological and clinical studies have suggested that the pathogenesis
  of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is strongly influenced by genetic predisposition.
  Beyond the limitations of linkage analysis, multiple genome-wide association studies,
  their meta-analyses, and targeted genotyping array techniques have broadened our
  understanding of the genetic architecture of IBD. Currently, over 200 single nucleotide
  polymorphisms are known to be associated with susceptibility to IBD and through
  functional analysis of genes and loci, a substantial proportion of pathophysiologic
  mechanisms have been revealed. However, because only a modest fraction of predicted
  heritability can be explained by known genes/loci, additional strategies are needed
  including the identification of rare variants with large effect sizes to help explain
  the missing heritability. Considerable progress is also being made on applying outcomes
  of genetic research in diagnostics, classification, prognostics, and the development
  of new therapeutics of IBD.
