abstract: "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Biomarkers are needed for early detection of Crohn's\
  \ disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) or to predict patient outcomes. Glycosylation\
  \ is a common and complex posttranslational modification of proteins that affects\
  \ their structure and activity. We compared plasma N-glycosylation profiles between\
  \ patients with CD or UC and healthy individuals (controls). METHODS: We analyzed\
  \ the total plasma N-glycomes of 2635 patients with inflammatory bowel diseases\
  \ and 996 controls by mass spectrometry with a linkage-specific sialic acid derivatization\
  \ technique. Plasma samples were acquired from 2 hospitals in Italy (discovery cohort,\
  \ 1989 patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] and 570 controls) and 1 medical\
  \ center in the United States (validation cohort, 646 cases of IBD and 426 controls).\
  \ Sixty-three glycoforms met our criteria for relative quantification and were extracted\
  \ from the raw data with the software MassyTools. Common features shared by the\
  \ glycan compositions were combined in 78 derived traits, including the number of\
  \ antennae of complex-type glycans and levels of fucosylation, bisection, galactosylation,\
  \ and sialylation. Associations of plasma N-glycomes with age, sex, CD, UC, and\
  \ IBD-related parameters such as disease location, surgery and medication, level\
  \ of C-reactive protein, and sedimentation rate were tested by linear and logistic\
  \ regression. RESULTS: Plasma samples from patients with IBD had a higher abundance\
  \ of large-size glycans compared with controls, a decreased relative abundance of\
  \ hybrid and high-mannose structures, lower fucosylation, lower galactosylation,\
  \ and higher sialylation (α2,3- and α2,6-linked). We could discriminate plasma from\
  \ patients with CD from that of patients with UC based on higher bisection, lower\
  \ galactosylation, and higher sialylation (α2,3-linked). Glycosylation patterns\
  \ were associated with disease location and progression, the need for a more potent\
  \ medication, and surgery. These results were replicated in a large independent\
  \ cohort. CONCLUSIONS: We performed high-throughput analysis to compare total plasma\
  \ N-glycomes of individuals with vs without IBD and to identify patterns associated\
  \ with disease features and the need for treatment. These profiles might be used\
  \ in diagnosis and for predicting patients' responses to treatment."
