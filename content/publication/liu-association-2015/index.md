abstract: Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the two main forms of inflammatory
  bowel disease (IBD). Here we report the first trans-ancestry association study of
  IBD, with genome-wide or Immunochip genotype data from an extended cohort of 86,640
  European individuals and Immunochip data from 9,846 individuals of East Asian, Indian
  or Iranian descent. We implicate 38 loci in IBD risk for the first  time. For the
  majority of the IBD risk loci, the direction and magnitude of effect are consistent
  in European and non-European cohorts. Nevertheless, we observe genetic heterogeneity
  between divergent populations at several established risk loci driven by differences
  in allele frequency (NOD2) or effect  size (TNFSF15 and ATG16L1) or a combination
  of these factors (IL23R and IRGM). Our results provide biological insights into
  the pathogenesis of IBD and demonstrate the usefulness of trans-ancestry association
  studies for mapping loci associated with complex diseases and understanding genetic
  architecture across diverse populations.
