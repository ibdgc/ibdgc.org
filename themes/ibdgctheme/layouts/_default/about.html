	        <p>The IBDGC has utilized the great wealth of well-characterized patients, biological samples, and data we have amassed to elucidate the mechanisms by which associated genetic variants influence pathophysiology. Moving forward, the IBDGC aims to focus on the following key challenges:</p>
	          <ol>
	            <li>Encompassing non-European populations more fully to identify cross-population differences in major effect genes as well as rare variants, thereby enhancing overall clinical predictions. </li>
	            <li>Integration of precision multi-omic approaches such as single cell RNA sequencing, development of enteroid lines, and utilization of sensitive protein assays to establish potential targets for novel therapies.</li>
	            <li>Engaging world-class scientists and clinicians in a way that enables seamless flow of information in an effort to consolidate data generated by ever-expanding technological advances.</li>

	        The NIDDK Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium’s (IBDGC) vision is to develop a thorough understanding of the genetic structure of IBD and use this to elucidate the pathophysiology of IBD for improved patient outcomes. The IBDGC was created to advance genetic research on Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Over the past 15 years, in collaboration with the International IBD Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC), we have identified about 200 susceptibility loci for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (collectively, Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis). These newly identified loci have significantly contributed to our understanding of the roles of the innate and acquired immune systems in the pathophysiology of IBD.</p>
		  <p class="white-text">The IBD Genetics Consortium was started in 2002 by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). During the first 5 year funding cycle collections included blood for DNA isolation and lymphoblastoid cell lines, and clinical phenotype data for affected independent cases, affected families, and probands with unaffected family controls. We also established a standard phenotyping manual and forms for IBD. Our Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) were instrumental in identifying top CD associated loci, specifically NOD2, IL23R and ATG16L1.</p>
		  <p class="white-text">Beginning in 2007 collections evolved with the recent genetic findings to focus primarily on independent cases, and population controls. We continued to collect blood for DNA isolation and lymphoblastoid cell lines, and added serum collections. During this time we joined the International IBDGC for several ground-breaking studies. Our GWAS studies were instrumental in identifying the top CD and UC associated loci, and have contributed greatly to several meta-analyses and, specific to CD and UC. These findings allowed us to collaborate with the auto-immune diseases community to design the ImmunoChip (iChip). With a combined total of over 75,000 subjects (IBD cases and controls) the total IBD associated loci to meet genome-wide significance was brought to 163. In addition we learned that many of these loci overlap with other auto-immune diseases, and mycobacterial infection.</p>
		  <p class="white-text">Beginning in 2007 collections evolved with the recent genetic findings to focus primarily on independent cases, and population controlIn 2012 we began adding value to the genetic associations with functional studies. For this phase we focused on collaborative, multi-disciplinary studies, designed to elucidate the mechanisms whereby risk-conferring genetic variants influence IBD pathophysiology. In addition to previous collections, we began collecting blood for RNA and PBMCs, surgical intestinal tissue and biopsies, and stool and diet. We continued to build on previous GWAS studies, with sequencing of additional populations, and more in-depth interrogation of specific loci with functional studies.</p>
		  <p class="white-text">Beginning in 2007 collections evolved with the recent genetic findings to focus primarily on independent cases, and population controlWe continue our focus on functional studies to elucidate the mechanisms whereby risk-conferring genetic variants influence IBD pathophysiology. With a solid understanding of genetic associations for IBD in European ancestry populations, one of our goals for the current phase is to expand IBD genetics to non-European populations. We will augment IBD resources and studies by reaching out to additional collaborators. Additional grant support from NIDDK via the ancillary R01 and R21 mechanism will expedite these collaborations.</p>

      <h5>Steering Committee</h5>
      <p>The governance structure of the Consortium has been very effective in making decisions about specific policies, projects and scientific direction. The Steering Committee (SC), makes all major decisions democratically (e.g., use of Consortium samples and DCC funds, project proposals including those from outside the Consortium and ancillary applications, working group structure). The PIs from each GRC serve as voting members. The chairs of the analytic and clinical translational subcommittees, representatives from NIDDK, the DCC Project Administrator and Technical Director of DCC Operations provide additional expertise and also serve as SC members.</p>
