After graduating from the University of Toronto, Faculty of Medicine in 1992, Dr. Mark Silverberg completed his internal medicine and gastroenterology training in Toronto in 1997. He then obtained a PhD studying the genetics of inflammatory bowel disease in 2002 at the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute of Mount Sinai Hospital. He is currently a Professor and Clinician Scientist in the Department of Medicine and holds the Gale and Graham Wright Research Chair in Digestive Diseases. He runs a laboratory based at Mount Sinai Hospital and the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute investigating the causes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

His research program has been funded by grants from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK/NIH), Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Crohn's and Colitis Canada (CCC) and the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA). His laboratory has focused on identifying susceptibility genes for IBD and to explain the contribution of genes and other biomarkers to its etiology and clinical course.

More recently he has expanded his program to study the relationship between serum immune responses, gene regulation and the host microbiome with genetic susceptibility. He has made significant contributions to the discovery of genes related to Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and paediatric IBD. He also has made major contributions to clinical IBD research in the field of phenomics, classification of IBD (The Montreal Classification) and as well as in optimal use of biologic therapy and therapeutic drug monitoring.

Dr. Silverberg has taken leadership positions on several international collaborative efforts with the goal of expediting scientific progress in the field of IBD. These include the International IBD Genetics Consortium, the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium and the CCFA Microbiome Initiative. Dr. Silverberg is also currently the Director of the Advanced IBD Fellowship Program at MSH and co-director of the Canadian GI Fellows Program in IBD.

His current projects are directed toward understanding the relationship between the microbiome in the digestive tract and host genotype allowing more insight into the role of diet and how food may trigger or exacerbate IBD. Ultimately he hopes to develop tools that will allow clinicians to better predict who may develop IBD and to identify high-risk patients so that a more personalized approach to treatment based on patients' unique genetic and bacterial signatures may be employed. Dr. Silverberg also runs a large clinical practice focused on IBD at Mount Sinai Hospital.

**Elucidating Pathophysiological Mechanisms of Intestinal Inflammation**
To date more than 200 genetic variants are known to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The majority of these have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The individual Genetic Research Centers (GRCs) and the collective NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) have successfully interacted for the last fifteen years to lead many of these discoveries. However, despite significant progress it is still unknown how the vast majority of these variants or other risk factors lead to development of IBD and its two major subtypes - Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Answering these questions is critical to advancing our knowledge of IBD pathophysiology. The University of Toronto GRC (UTGRC), led by Dr. Mark Silverberg, has made unique and substantial contributions in this field by virtue of its longstanding clinical and genetics expertise in IBD. Since 2002, Dr. Silverberg has established a very large, comprehensive registry of well characterized, longitudinally followed IBD patients at Mount Sinai Hospital in addition to accompanying biospecimens stored at his laboratory at the Lunenfeld- Tanenbaum Research Institute in order to facilitate research in IBD. Utilizing these resources, the UTGRC will advance the understanding of UC pathophysiology in the following ways: (1) Identify gene expression profiles and pathways that will aid in understanding the mechanisms of UC relapse and prediction of UC relapse and their regulation by miRNAs and chromatin accessibility. This will be accomplished by measuring gene expression, miRNA and chromatic accessibility profiles in the colonic tissue of UC subjects immediately prior to the onset of inflammation relative to baseline measurements. (2) Identify intestinal microbes and microbial function that precede UC relapse. This will be accomplished by determining the composition of the microbial flora adherent to the intestinal tissue as well as that of stool sampled at and comparing the same time points described in (1). (3) Continue to support the mutually agreed upon Consortium-wide studies involving elucidating the factors contributing to relapse of inflammation following surgery in CD subjects, completing the discovery of all genetic variation associated with IBD, advancing our knowledge of the functional biology of such genetic variation and to utilize these data to bring clinically meaningful tools into use to promote improved outcomes for individuals affected by IBD. These will be accomplished by patient recruitment and by bringing our significant clinical and scientific expertise to the IBDGC. This will be accomplished by ongoing clinical patient and biospecimen recruitment and by bringing significant clinical and scientific expertise to the Consortium team.

**Diet intervention as a prebiotic treatment for active ulcerative colitis**
The purpose of this study is to determine if a sustainable non-elemental diet can be used as a probiotic tool to alter the dysbiotic microbiome found in individuals with ulcerative colitis and thereby decrease disease activity.
