abstract: "BACKGROUND: African Americans (AAs) are an admixed population of West African\
  \ (WA) and European ancestry (EA). Crohn's disease (CD) susceptibility genes have\
  \ not been established. We therefore evaluated the contribution of European admixture\
  \ and major established risk genes to AA CD. METHODS: Ninety-seven admixture informative\
  \ markers were genotyped for ancestry estimates using STRUCTURE. Overall, 354 AA\
  \ CD cases and 354 ethnicity-matched controls were genotyped for total 21 single\
  \ nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ATG16L1, NOD2, IBD5, IL23R and IRGM by TaqMan\
  \ or direct sequencing. Association was evaluated by logistic regression, adjusted\
  \ for ancestry. RESULTS: Mean EA was similar among the CD cases and controls (20.9%\
  \ and 20.4%, respectively, P = 0.58). No significant admixture differences were\
  \ observed among 211 to 227 cases stratified by phenotypic subclassifications including\
  \ onset, surgery, site, and behavior. CD was associated with NOD2 carrier (6.93%\
  \ CD, 2.15% Controls, P = 0.007), ATG16L1 Thr300Ala (36.1% CD, 29.3% Controls, P\
  \ = 0.003), SLC22A4 and SLC22A5 (IBD5 locus) functional SNPs (Leu503Phe [10.5% CD,\
  \ 7.6% Controls, P = 0.05] and g-207c [41.3% CD, 35.7% Controls, P = 0.03], respectively),\
  \ and IL23R rs2201841 (18.2% CD, 13.8% Controls, P = 0.03), but not IRGM variants,\
  \ nor three African ancestral NOD2 nonsynonymous variants. IBD5 risk was recessive.\
  \ An all-minor allele IBD5 haplotype from EA was associated (P = 0.05), whereas\
  \ a more common haplotype isolating g-207c was not. CONCLUSIONS: Specific functional\
  \ gene variations contribute significantly to AA CD risk. Established NOD2, SLC22A4-A5,\
  \ and ATG16L1 variants show increased CD risk, with IBD5 recessive. Although CD\
  \ is more common in whites, European admixture is similar among AA cases and controls."
