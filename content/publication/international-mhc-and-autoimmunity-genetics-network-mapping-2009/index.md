abstract: The human MHC represents the strongest susceptibility locus for autoimmune
  diseases. However, the identification of the true predisposing gene(s) has been
  handicapped by the strong linkage disequilibrium across the region. Furthermore,
  most studies to date have been limited to the examination of a subset of the HLA
  and non-HLA genes with a marker density and sample size insufficient for mapping
  all independent association signals. We genotyped a panel of 1,472 SNPs to capture
  the common genomic variation across the 3.44 megabase (Mb) classic MHC region in
  10,576 DNA samples derived from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, Crohn's
  disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, selective
  IgA deficiency, multiple sclerosis, and appropriate control samples. We identified
  the primary association signals for each disease and performed conditional regression
  to identify independent secondary signals. The data demonstrate that MHC associations
  with autoimmune diseases result from complex, multilocus effects that span the entire
  region.
