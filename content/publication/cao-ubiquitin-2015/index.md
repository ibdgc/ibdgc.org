abstract: "CARD9 is a central component of anti-fungal innate immune signaling via C-type lectin receptors, and several immune-related disorders are associated with CARD9 alterations. Here, we used a rare CARD9 variant that confers protection against inflammatory bowel disease as an entry point to investigating CARD9 regulation. We showed that the protective variant of CARD9, which is C-terminally truncated, acted in a dominant-negative manner for CARD9-mediated cytokine production, indicating an important role for the C terminus in CARD9 signaling. We identified TRIM62 as a CARD9 binding partner and showed that TRIM62 facilitated K27-linked poly-ubiquitination of CARD9. We identified K125 as the ubiquitinated residue on CARD9 and demonstrated that this ubiquitination was essential for CARD9 activity. Furthermore, we showed that similar to Card9-deficient mice, Trim62-deficient mice had increased susceptibility to fungal infection. In this study, we utilized a rare protective allele to uncover a TRIM62-mediated mechanism for regulation of CARD9 activation."
