#bio: ["Since his move to Montreal in 2005 Dr. Rioux has been the Director of the Laboratory in Genetics and Genomic Medicine of Inflammation, and more recently the Director of the MHI/UdeM Integrative Biology Platform and the High-Performance Sorting Platform. He is a founding member of multiple international consortia and currently co-leads the International IBD Genetics Consortium, is Chair of the Steering Committee of the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium and is the leader of the IBD Genomic Medicine (iGenoMed) Consortium.", "Dr. Rioux’s research focuses on three main areas: (1) genetic studies to identify risk factors for common and rare diseases; (2) functional studies using human models, including iPSC-derived epithelial and immune models, to understand how genetic risk factors protect or predispose to disease; and (3) integrative human studies to identify biomarkers of important clinical outcomes, in particular response to molecularly-targeted therapies. Dr. Rioux’s work has led to over 200 publications, cited over 30,000 times."]

### NIDDK IBDGC-related funding

#### Montreal-Boston Collaborative IBD Genetic Research Center (DK062432; PI: Rioux)

The objective of this study is to identify the root causes of disease, so that we reveal the key targets for more precise and effective therapies for CD and UC in order to improve the quality of life of patients with CD and UC and eventually lead to the cure of these otherwise lifelong debilitating diseases.

**Specific Aim 1:**  To characterize the genetic architecture of IBD phenotypes within populations currently underrepresented in IBD genomic research.

**Specific Aim 2:** To exploit longitudinal multi ‘omic approaches to reveal the biological causes of the clinical heterogeneity of IBD and differential treatment response.

**Specific Aim 3:** Analysis of the newly identified CD gene PDLIM5 and its splice region variant and their impact on epithelial functions.

#### Major interests

- Genetic and genomic studies to identify risk factors for IBD;
- Functional studies using human models, including iPSC-derived epithelial and immune models, to understand how genetic risk factors protect or predispose to disease; and
- Integrative human studies to identify biomarkers of important clinical outcomes, in particular response to molecularly-targeted therapies.
