abstract: A mysterious feature of Crohn’s disease (CD) is the extra-intestinal manifestation
  of ‘‘creeping fat’’ (CrF), deﬁned as expansion of mesenteric adipose tissue around
  the inﬂamed and ﬁbrotic intestine. In the current study, we explore whether microbial
  translocation in CD serves as a central cue for CrF development. We discovered a
  subset of mucosal-associated gut bacteria that consistently translocated and remained
  viable in CrF in CD ileal surgical resections, and identiﬁed Clostridium innocuum
  as a signature of this consortium with strain variation between mucosal and adipose
  isolates, suggesting preference for lipid-rich environments. Single-cell RNA sequencing
  characterized CrF as both pro-ﬁbrotic and pro-adipogenic with a rich milieu of activated
  immune cells responding to microbial stimuli, which we conﬁrm in gnotobiotic mice
  colonized with C. innocuum. Ex vivo validation of expression patterns suggests C.
  innocuum stimulates tissue remodeling via M2 macrophages, leading to an adipose
  tissue barrier that serves to prevent systemic dissemination of bacteria.
