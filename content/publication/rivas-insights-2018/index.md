abstract: As part of a broader collaborative network of exome sequencing studies,
  we developed a jointly called data set of 5,685 Ashkenazi Jewish exomes. We make
  publicly available a resource of site and allele frequencies, which should serve
  as a reference for medical genetics in the Ashkenazim (hosted in part at https://ibd.broadinstitute.org,
  also available in gnomAD at http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org). We estimate that
  34% of protein-coding alleles present in the Ashkenazi Jewish population at frequencies
  greater than 0.2% are significantly more frequent (mean 15-fold) than their maximum
  frequency observed in other reference populations. Arising via a well-described
  founder effect approximately 30 generations ago, this catalog of enriched alleles
  can contribute to differences in genetic risk and overall prevalence of diseases
  between populations. As validation we document 148 AJ enriched protein-altering
  alleles that overlap with \"pathogenic\" ClinVar alleles (table available at https://github.com/macarthur-lab/clinvar/blob/master/output/clinvar.tsv),
  including those that account for 10-100 fold differences in prevalence between AJ
  and non-AJ populations of some rare diseases, especially recessive conditions, including
  Gaucher disease (GBA, p.Asn409Ser, 8-fold enrichment); Canavan disease (ASPA, p.Glu285Ala,
  12-fold enrichment); and Tay-Sachs disease (HEXA, c.1421+1GtextgreaterC, 27-fold
  enrichment; p.Tyr427IlefsTer5, 12-fold enrichment). We next sought to use this catalog,
  of well-established relevance to Mendelian disease, to explore Crohn's disease,
  a common disease with an estimated two to four-fold excess prevalence in AJ. We
  specifically attempt to evaluate whether strong acting rare alleles, particularly
  protein-truncating or otherwise large effect-size alleles, enriched by the same
  founder-effect, contribute excess genetic risk to Crohn's disease in AJ, and find
  that ten rare genetic risk factors in NOD2 and LRRK2 are enriched in AJ (p textless
  0.005), including several novel contributing alleles, show evidence of association
  to CD. Independently, we find that genomewide common variant risk defined by GWAS
  shows a strong difference between AJ and non-AJ European control population samples
  (0.97 s.d. higher, ptextless10-16). Taken together, the results suggest coordinated
  selection in AJ population for higher CD risk alleles in general. The results and
  approach illustrate the value of exome sequencing data in case-control studies along
  with reference data sets like ExAC (sites VCF available via FTP at ftp.broadinstitute.org/pub/ExAC_release/release0.3/)
  to pinpoint genetic variation that contributes to variable disease predisposition
  across populations.
