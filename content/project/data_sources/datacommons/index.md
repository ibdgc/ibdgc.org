To further enhance data sharing and collaboration, the IBDGC DCC has built a Data Commons based on the Gen3 platform. Gen3 is the same platform that powers the NCI Genomic Data Commons as well as several other NIH and privately funded data commons. The IBD Data Commons permits rapid, secure sharing of data as well as the ability to compute over those data in the cloud and establish reproducible QC and analytic pipelines.
