abstract: Abstract  Background Crohn’s disease (CD) can affect any segment of the
  digestive tract but is most often localized in the ileal, ileocolonic, and colorectal
  regions of the intestines. It is believed that the chronic inflammation in CD is
  a result of an imbalance between the epithelial barrier, the immune system, and
  the intestinal microbiota. The aim of the study was to identify circulating markers
  associated with CD and/or disease location in CD patients.   Methods We tested 49
  cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in serum samples from 300 patients with
  CD and 300 controls. After quality control, analyte levels were tested for association
  with CD and disease location.   Results We identified 13 analytes that were higher
  in CD patients relative to healthy controls and that remained significant after
  conservative Bonferroni correction (P &lt; 0.0015). In particular, CXCL9, CXCL1,
  and interleukin IL-6 had the greatest effect and were highly significant (P &lt; 5 × 10–7).
  We also identified 9 analytes that were associated with disease location, with VEGF,
  IL-12p70, and IL-6 being elevated in patients with colorectal disease (P &lt; 3 × 10–4).   Conclusions
  Multiple serum analytes are elevated in CD. These implicate the involvement of multiple
  cell types from the immune, epithelial, and endothelial systems, suggesting that
  circulating analytes reflect the inflammatory processes that are ongoing within
  the gut. Moreover, the identification of distinct profiles according to disease
  location supports the existence of a biological difference between ileal and colonic
  CD, consistent with previous genetic and clinical observations.
