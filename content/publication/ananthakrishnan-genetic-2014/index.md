abstract: "BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is a well-established environmental risk\
  \ factor for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The exact mechanism\
  \ of its effect remains unexplained. Genetic polymorphisms in metabolizing enzymes\
  \ may influence susceptibility to the effect of smoking and shed light on its mechanism\
  \ of action. METHODS: We used a prospective cohort of patients with CD, UC, and\
  \ healthy controls. Smoking status was defined as current, former, or never smoking.\
  \ Patients were genotyped for polymorphisms in CYP2A6, glutathione transferase enzymes\
  \ (GSTP1 and GSTM1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO), and heme oxygenase 1\
  \ using a Sequenom platform. Multivariate logistic regression models with CD or\
  \ UC as the outcome, stratified by genotype, were developed and interaction P-values\
  \ calculated. RESULTS: Our study included 634 patients with CD, 401 with UC, and\
  \ 337 healthy controls. Ever smokers had an increased risk of CD (odds ratio = 3.88,\
  \ 95% confidence interval = 2.35-6.39) compared with nonsmokers among patients with\
  \ AG/AA genotypes at CYP2A6. However, ever smoking was not associated with CD among\
  \ patients with the AA genotype (Pinteraction = 0.001). Former smoking was associated\
  \ with an increased risk for UC only in the presence of GG/AG genotypes for GSTP1\
  \ but not in those with the AA genotype (Pinteraction = 0.012). Polymorphisms at\
  \ the NQO and HMOX loci did not demonstrate a statistically significant interaction\
  \ with smoking and risk of CD or UC. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic polymorphisms in metabolizing\
  \ enzymes may influence the association between smoking and CD and UC. Further studies\
  \ of gene-environment interaction in inflammatory bowel disease are warranted."
