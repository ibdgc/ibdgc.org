abstract: A primary goal of human genetics is to identify DNA sequence variants that
  influence biomedical traits, particularly those related to the onset and progression
  of human disease. Over the past 25 years, progress in realizing this objective has
  been transformed by advances in technology, foundational genomic resources and analytical
  tools, and by access to vast amounts of genotype and phenotype data. Genetic discoveries
  have substantially improvedÂ our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for
  many rare and common diseases and driven development of novel preventative and therapeutic
  strategies. Medical innovation will increasingly focus on delivering care tailored
  to individual patterns of genetic predisposition.
