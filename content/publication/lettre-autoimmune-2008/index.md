abstract: "Autoimmune diseases occur when an individual's own immune system attacks\
  \ and destroys his or her healthy cells and tissues. Although it is clear that environmental\
  \ stimuli can predispose someone to develop autoimmune diseases, twin- and family-based\
  \ studies have shown that genetic factors also play an important role in modifying\
  \ disease risk. Because many of these diseases are relatively common (prevalence\
  \ in European-derived populations: 0.01-1%) and exhibit a complex mode of inheritance,\
  \ many DNA sequence variants with modest effect on disease risk contribute to the\
  \ genetic burden. Recently, the completion of the HapMap project, together with\
  \ the development of new genotyping technologies, has given human geneticists the\
  \ tools necessary to comprehensively, and in an unbiased manner, search our genome\
  \ for DNA polymorphisms associated with many autoimmune diseases. Here we review\
  \ recent progress made in the identification of genetic risk factors for celiac\
  \ disease, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus\
  \ erythematosus and type-1 diabetes using genome-wide association studies (GWAS).\
  \ Strikingly, GWAS have increased the number of genetic risk variants associated\
  \ with these autoimmune diseases from 15 before 2006 to 68 now. We summarize what\
  \ this new genetic landscape teaches us in terms of the pathogenesis of these diseases,\
  \ and highlight some of the outstanding challenges ahead. Finally, we open a discussion\
  \ on ways to best maximize the impact of these genetic discoveries where it matters\
  \ the most, that is for autoimmune disease patients."
