abstract: "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) gene (MEFV)\
  \ encodes pyrin, a major regulator of the inflammasome platform controlling caspase-1\
  \ activation and IL-1beta processing. Pyrin has been shown to interact with the\
  \ gene product of NLRP3, NALP3/cryopyrin, also an important active member of the\
  \ inflammasome. The NLRP3 region was recently reported to be associated with Crohn's\
  \ disease (CD) susceptibility. We therefore sought to evaluate MEFV as an inflammatory\
  \ bowel disease (IBD) susceptibility gene. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: MEFV colonic\
  \ mucosal gene expression was significantly increased in experimental colitis mice\
  \ models (TNBS ptextless0.0003; DSS ptextless0.006), in biopsies from CD (ptextless0.02)\
  \ and severe ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (ptextless0.008). Comprehensive genetic\
  \ screening of the MEFV region in the Belgian exploratory sample set (440 CD trios,\
  \ 137 UC trios, 239 CD cases, 96 UC cases, and 107 healthy controls) identified\
  \ SNPs located in the MEFV 5' haplotype block that were significantly associated\
  \ with UC (rs224217; p = 0.003; A allele frequency: 56% cases, 45% controls), while\
  \ no CD associations were observed. Sequencing and subsequent genotyping of variants\
  \ located in this associated haplotype block identified three synonymous variants\
  \ (D102D/rs224225, G138G/rs224224, A165A/rs224223) and one non-synonymous variant\
  \ (R202Q/rs224222) located in MEFV exon 2 that were significantly associated with\
  \ UC (rs224222: p = 0.0005; A allele frequency: 32% in cases, 23% in controls).\
  \ No consistent associations were observed in additional Canadian (256 CD trios,\
  \ 91 UC trios) and Scottish (495 UC, 370 controls) sample sets. We note that rs224222\
  \ showed marginal association (p = 0.012; G allele frequency: 82% in cases, 70%\
  \ in controls) in the Canadian sample, but with a different risk allele. None of\
  \ the NLRP3 common variants were associated with UC in the Belgian-Canadian UC samples\
  \ and no significant interactions were observed between NLRP3 and MEFV that could\
  \ explain the observed flip-flop of the rs224222 risk allele. CONCLUSION: The differences\
  \ in association levels observed between the sample sets may be a consequence of\
  \ distinct founder effects or of the relative small sample size of the cohorts evaluated\
  \ in this study. However, the results suggest that common variants in the MEFV region\
  \ do not contribute to CD and UC susceptibility."
