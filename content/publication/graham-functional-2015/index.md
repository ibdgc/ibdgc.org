abstract: The phagocyte oxidative burst, mediated by Nox2 NADPH oxidase-derived reactive
  oxygen species, confers host defense against a broad spectrum of bacterial and fungal
  pathogens. Loss-of-function mutations that impair function of the Nox2 complex result
  in a life-threatening immunodeficiency, and genetic variants of Nox2 subunits have
  been implicated in pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Thus, alterations
  in the oxidative burst can profoundly impact host defense, yet little is known about
  regulatory mechanisms that fine-tune this response. Here we report the discovery
  of regulatory nodes controlling oxidative burst by functional screening of genes
  within loci linked to human inflammatory disease. Implementing a multi-omics approach,
  we define transcriptional, metabolic and ubiquitin-cycling nodes controlled by Rbpj,
  Pfkl and Rnf145, respectively. Furthermore, we implicate Rnf145 in proteostasis
  of the Nox2 complex by endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. Consequently,
  ablation of Rnf145 in murine macrophages enhances bacterial clearance, and rescues
  the oxidative burst defects associated with Ncf4 haploinsufficiency.
