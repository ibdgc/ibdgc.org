## Mechanisms of intestinal inflammation following ileal resection for Crohn’s Disease

We are currently recruiting for a multi-center Crohn’s Disease study. The
purpose of this study is to gain further understanding of the mechanisms
involved in the recurrence of inflammation following ileal resection surgery
for Crohn’s disease (CD). One of the most common locations of CD involvement
is the end of the small intestine (ileum), up to 70% of CD patients require
surgical resections due to disease at this location. Such surgical management
is often a temporary solution as more than 50% of these patients experience
recurrence of inflammation one year post surgery, and 90% at five to 10 years
following surgery. Reasons for this recurrence remain unknown, however it is
believed to be caused by an interaction of genetic, immune and microbial
features.

We are conducting analyses on blood, surgical tissue, stool and intestinal
biopsy. Studying the IBD specific inflammation, which is localized to the
intestine, will lead to a better understanding of the pathways important for
intestinal immune system regulation. The complexity of IBD is based on the
working belief that gastrointestinal inflammation is a result of an
unregulated response of the immune system to intestinal bacteria, which we
will be able to study with biopsies and stool. Information gained from this
study will be used to build a predictive model to identify those patients at
greater risk of rapid recurrence, and will aid physicians in tailoring
follow-up treatments.

If you are scheduled to undergo or recently underwent an ileal resection
surgery for treatment of CD, and are interested in participating in this
study, contact the IBDGC Genetic Research Center (GRC) closest to you.

If you are a clinician and would like to participate as an affiliate
recruitment center please contact Ksenija Sabic.


## IBD Genetics of Non-European Populations

Crohn’s disease incidence in African Americans (AA) is similar to that of
white Americans, although population based prevalence lags behind. In one
population study the ratio of CD incident cases was 1.6 fold that of UC,
whereas in white, the ratio was 0.9. This suggests that there might be unique
ancestral risk factors in AA CD. Additionally, the NIDDK IBDGC discovered that
AA had significantly greater risk of colon-only and perianal disease location,
and greater risk of uveitis and spondyloarthritis. Along with Subra Kugathasan
at Emory University and other IBDGC affiliates, we have genotyped or conducted
whole genome sequencing on over 3000 African Americans.

The incidences of IBD is also increasing in other non-European populations,
specifically Hispanics and, Far East and South Asians. We are exploring new
avenues to begin collections of samples and clinical data from these
populations.

If you are of African American, Hispanic, Far East or South Asian heritage,
have been diagnosed with CD or UC, and are interested in participating in this
or future studies, contact the IBDGC Genetic Research Center (GRC) closest to
you.

## Mechanisms of microbiota in mucosal inflammation across the biologic demarcation of Ulcerative Colitis

The long-term purpose of this study is to increase knowledge about IBD to
better understand its causes and improve diagnosis, treatment, or even
prevention. The immediate objective is to gain further understanding of the
mechanisms involved in the susceptibility to and flare of inflammation in UC
patients, by evaluating the genetic, microbial, gene expression and
serological factors associated with mucosal inflammation. For this study, we
will collect mucosal lavage (a solution which bathes the mucosal surface),
mucosal biopsy (a small piece of tissue taken from the mucosal surface),
blood, saliva, and stool samples from UC individuals. For mucosal lavage,
saliva, and stool samples, microbial studies will be carried out to identify
the bacteria associated with IBD. Additional studies will be carried out to
understand the interaction between the bacteria and the host.

We believe the information we get from this project will help understand the
role of intestinal bacteria in UC initiation and development, identify the
specific bacteria, metabolites, and proteins associated with UC, and how the
host effectively responds as a whole.

This study is closed to new recruitment.
