abstract: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory intestinal disease, with
  frequent aberrant healing and stricturing complications. Crosstalk between activated
  myeloid and stromal cells is critical in pathogenicity1,2 with increases in intravasating
  monocytes correlated to anti-TNF treatment non-response3. The highest effect risk
  alleles are loss-of-function NOD24,5 mutations, which increase risk for stricturing6.
  However, mechanisms underlying NOD2-pathogenicity and salvage pathways in anti-TNF
  refractory patients remain largely uncharacterized. Here we show that NOD2 loss
  leads to dysregulated activated fibroblast and macrophage homeostasis by direct
  ex vivo analyses of patients carrying NOD2 risk alleles. CD14+PBMCs from NOD2 carriers
  produce collagen-high expressing cells, and elevation of conserved signatures is
  observed in nod2-deficient zebrafish models of intestinal injury. Enrichment of
  STAT3 regulation and gp130-ligands in activated fibroblasts and macrophages led
  us to reason that gp130 blockade might rescue the activated program. We correlate
  post-treatment induction of this pathway in anti-TNF non-responders and demonstrate
  in vivo amelioration of the activated myeloid-stromal niche, using a specific gp130
  inhibitor, bazedoxifene. Our results demonstrate novel biological insights into
  NOD2-driven fibrosis in CD; gp130 blockade may benefit selected CD patients, potentially
  complementing anti-TNF therapy.
