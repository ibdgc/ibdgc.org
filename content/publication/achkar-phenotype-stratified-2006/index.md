abstract: "OBJECTIVES: The complete elucidation of genetic variants that contribute\
  \ to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will likely include variants that increase\
  \ risk  to both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis as well as variants that\
  \ increase  risk for particular phenotypic subsets. The purpose of this study was\
  \ to assess phenotypic subsets that contribute to the major IBD susceptibility loci.\
  \ METHODS: This linkage study encompassed 904 affected relative pairs, representing\
  \ the largest combined phenotyped cohort to date, and allowing for meaningful subset\
  \ analyses. Genetic linkage data were stratified by disease location and age at\
  \ diagnosis. RESULTS: We establish that some loci, notably the IBD3 and chromosome\
  \  3q linkage regions demonstrate contributions from both small intestine and colon\
  \  cohorts, whereas others, notably the IBD1 (NOD2/CARD15) and IBD2 regions increase\
  \ risk for small intestine or colon inflammation, respectively. The strongest linkage\
  \ evidence in this study was for the subset of extensive ulcerative colitis in the\
  \ region of IBD2 (lod 3.27; p textless 0.001). Evidence for linkage in the region\
  \ of NOD2/CARD15 (IBD1) was stronger for the subset of Crohn's patients with ileal\
  \  disease (lod 2.56; p= 0.035) compared to the overall Crohn's group, consistent\
  \ with previous findings that NOD2/CARD15 variants are associated with ileal disease.\
  \ CONCLUSIONS: Analyses incorporating disease location in IBD increase the power\
  \ and enhance the accuracy of genomic localization. Our data provide strong evidence\
  \ that extensive ulcerative colitis represents a pathophysiologic subset of IBD."
