abstract: "BACKGROUND: The molecular aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]\
  \ and its two subtypes, ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD], have been\
  \ carefully investigated at genome and transcriptome levels. Recent advances in\
  \ high-throughput proteome quantification has enabled comprehensive large-scale\
  \ plasma proteomics studies of IBD. METHODS: The study used two cohorts: [1] The\
  \ CERTIFI-cohort: 42 samples from the CERTIFI trial of anti-TNFÎ±-refractory CD patients;\
  \ [2] the PROgECT-UNITI-HCs cohort: 46 UC samples of the PROgECT study, 84 CD samples\
  \ of the UNITI I and UNITI II studies, and 72 healthy controls recruited in Mount\
  \ Sinai Hospital, New York, USA. The plasma proteome for these two cohorts was quantified\
  \ using high-throughput platforms. RESULTS: For the PROgECT-UNITI-HCs cohort, we\
  \ measured a total of 1310 proteins. Of these, 493 proteins showed different plasma\
  \ levels in IBD patients to the plasma levels in controls at 10% false discovery\
  \ rate [FDR], among which 11 proteins had a fold change greater than 2. The proteins\
  \ upregulated in IBD were associated with immunity functionality, whereas the proteins\
  \ downregulated in IBD were associated with nutrition and metabolism. The proteomic\
  \ profiles were very similar between UC and CD. In the CERTIFI cohort, 1014 proteins\
  \ were measured, and it was found that the plasma protein level had little correlation\
  \ with the blood or intestine transcriptomes. CONCLUSIONS: We report the largest\
  \ proteomics study to date on IBD and controls. A large proportion of plasma proteins\
  \ are altered in IBD, which provides insights into the disease aetiology and indicates\
  \ a potential for biomarker discovery."
