abstract: "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) has the highest prevalence in Ashkenazi\
  \ Jewish populations. We sought to identify rare, CD-associated frameshift variants\
  \ of high functional and statistical effects. METHODS: We performed exome sequencing\
  \ and array-based genotype analyses of 1477 Ashkenazi Jewish individuals with CD\
  \ and 2614 Ashkenazi Jewish individuals without CD (controls). To validate our findings,\
  \ we performed genotype analyses of an additional 1515 CD cases and 7052 controls\
  \ for frameshift mutations in the colony-stimulating factor 2-receptor β common\
  \ subunit gene (CSF2RB). Intestinal tissues and blood samples were collected from\
  \ patients with CD; lamina propria leukocytes were isolated and expression of CSF2RB\
  \ and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-responsive cells were defined\
  \ by adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF analysis).\
  \ Variants of CSF2RB were transfected into HEK293 cells and the expression and functions\
  \ of gene products were compared. RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, we associated\
  \ CD with a frameshift mutation in CSF2RB (P = 8.52 × 10(-4)); the finding was validated\
  \ in the replication cohort (combined P = 3.42 × 10(-6)). Incubation of intestinal\
  \ lamina propria leukocytes with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor\
  \ resulted in high levels of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator\
  \ of transcription (STAT5) and lesser increases in phosphorylation of extracellular\
  \ signal-regulated kinase and AK straining transforming (AKT). Cells co-transfected\
  \ with full-length and mutant forms of CSF2RB had reduced pSTAT5 after stimulation\
  \ with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, compared with cells transfected\
  \ with control CSF2RB, indicating a dominant-negative effect of the mutant gene.\
  \ Monocytes from patients with CD who were heterozygous for the frameshift mutation\
  \ (6% of CD cases analyzed) had reduced responses to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating\
  \ factor and markedly decreased activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase; activity of\
  \ this enzyme has been associated with immune tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: In a genetic\
  \ analysis of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, we associated CD with a frameshift mutation\
  \ in CSF2RB. Intestinal monocytes from carriers of this mutation had reduced responses\
  \ to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, providing an additional mechanism\
  \ for alterations to the innate immune response in individuals with CD."
