### NIDDK IBDGC-related goals

#### Specific Aims

**Aim 1:** Characterize the genetic structure of Hispanic patients with IBD and the role of ancestry in genetic risk.

**Aim 2:** Determine the effect of environmental exposures on modifying IBD phenotypic expression in Hispanic patients and the impact of ancestry.

**Aim 3:** Examine differences between foreign-born and US-born CD Hispanics in innate immune cell gene expression from ileum and colon using multi-omic approaches.

#### Additional resources at Cedars-Sinai

- UM IBD Clinical Phenotype Database and Tissue Repository: Overseen by Drs. Abreu and McCauley, this resource contains >3,000 enrolled IBD patients with deep phenotyping and a wealth of stored biospecimens including endoscopic biopsies, DNA, serum, plasma, PBMCs, feces/colon washes, and Paxgene RNA.
- John P. Hussman Institute for Human Genomics: Dr. McCauley directs multiple core laboratories for biobanking, sequencing, and genotyping within the Institute.

#### Major interests

Dr. McCauley's primary interest is to improve the understanding of human disease through disease gene discovery, genomics, and in-depth examination of environmental factors that influence disease outcomes. He has worked on understanding the genetic factors involved in numerous complex genetic diseases and within the last decade has focused efforts on understanding the genetic factors effecting diseases within historically underrepresented populations in research. The generalization of current genetic research findings to individuals of different genetic backgrounds is a significant and unanswered question in research, especially in light of reported differences in prevalence, clinical course, and progression of different diseases across populations. Understanding the biology behind these differences can help us to better understand IBD and other related diseases.
