abstract: "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, such as infliximab\
  \ (IFX), have been increasingly used to induce and maintain disease remission in\
  \ patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Despite a considerable non-response rate,\
  \ little is known about the genetic predictors of response to anti-TNF therapy in\
  \ CD. Our aim in this study was to investigate the genetic factors associated with\
  \ response to anti-TNF therapy in patients with CD. METHODS: We performed a two-stage\
  \ genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify loci influencing the response\
  \ to IFX among Korean patients with CD, comprising 42 good responders with mucosal\
  \ healing and 70 non-responders. The achievement of mucosal healing was assessed\
  \ by endoscopy and imaging. The functional significance of TRAP1 (TNF receptor associated\
  \ protein 1) was examined using dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis model in\
  \ TRAP1 transgenic mice. RESULTS: The GWAS identified rs2158962, an intronic single\
  \ nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of TRAP1, significantly associated with mucosal\
  \ healing (odds ratio = 4.94; Pcombined  = 1.35 × 10-7 ). In the dextran sodium\
  \ sulfate-induced acute colitis, TRAP1 transgenic mice showed a better response\
  \ to IFX than the wild-type mice. CONCLUSIONS: The TRAP1 gene is associated with\
  \ mucosal healing in CD patients following IFX therapy. Identifying the genetic\
  \ predictors of mucosal healing to anti-TNF therapy can prevent patients from exposure\
  \ to ineffective therapies."
