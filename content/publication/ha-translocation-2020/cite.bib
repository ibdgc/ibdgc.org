 abstract = {A mysterious feature of Crohn’s disease (CD) is the extra-intestinal manifestation of ‘‘creeping fat’’ (CrF), deﬁned as expansion of mesenteric adipose tissue around the inﬂamed and ﬁbrotic intestine. In the current study, we explore whether microbial translocation in CD serves as a central cue for CrF development. We discovered a subset of mucosal-associated gut bacteria that consistently translocated and remained viable in CrF in CD ileal surgical resections, and identiﬁed Clostridium innocuum as a signature of this consortium with strain variation between mucosal and adipose isolates, suggesting preference for lipid-rich environments. Single-cell RNA sequencing characterized CrF as both pro-ﬁbrotic and pro-adipogenic with a rich milieu of activated immune cells responding to microbial stimuli, which we conﬁrm in gnotobiotic mice colonized with C. innocuum. Ex vivo validation of expression patterns suggests C. innocuum stimulates tissue remodeling via M2 macrophages, leading to an adipose tissue barrier that serves to prevent systemic dissemination of bacteria.},
