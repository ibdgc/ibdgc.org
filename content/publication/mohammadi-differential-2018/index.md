abstract: "Background and Aims: MicroRNAs [miRNAs] have emerged as important regulators\
  \ in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. This study investigated differential expression\
  \ of miRNAs across clinical phenotypes in a well-characterized cohort of IBD patients\
  \ and healthy controls [HCs]. Methods: A cohort of Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative\
  \ colitis [UC] patients and HCs was prospectively accrued. Total RNA was extracted\
  \ from peripheral blood mononuclear cells for all subjects. miRNA expression was\
  \ measured using NanoString technologies. The subjects were stratified according\
  \ to disease activity and location. Statistical significance was assessed per miRNA\
  \ across outcomes and corrected for multiple testing. miRNA regulation of transcription\
  \ of important results was confirmed in vitro by a dual luciferase reporter assay\
  \ and autophagy function was evaluated using immunofluorescence imaging of LC3 puncta\
  \ in HeLa cells. Results: In total, 120 subjects were enrolled. Seventy-four miRNAs\
  \ were differentially expressed across CD, UC and HCs. Comparing quiescent CD [CDq]\
  \ with HCs we found ten miRNAs upregulated in CDq. When comparing colonic CD [CCD]\
  \ to UC, seven miRNAs were upregulated in CCD. The most differentially expressed\
  \ miRNA in CCD vs UC was miR-874-3p, and we showed its possible utility as a biomarker\
  \ of differential diagnosis. We showed miR-874-3p targets ATG16L1 and reduces its\
  \ expression in vitro. An miR-874-3p mimic dysregulates autophagy by a reduction\
  \ of LC3 in vitro. Conclusions: We identified unique miRNA signatures expressed\
  \ in distinct IBD phenotypes. These associations highlight pathways dysregulated\
  \ by aberrant miRNA expression, revealing possible mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology\
  \ of IBD, but also suggest a cluster of miRNAs as readily accessible biomarkers\
  \ to aid in differential diagnosis."
