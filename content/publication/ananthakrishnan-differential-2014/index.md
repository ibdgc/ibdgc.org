abstract: "OBJECTIVES: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic\
  \ immunologically mediated diseases with a progressive relapsing remitting course.\
  \ There is considerable heterogeneity in disease course and accurate prediction\
  \ of natural history has been challenging. The phenotypic implication of increasing\
  \ genetic predisposition to CD or UC is unknown. METHODS: The data source for our\
  \ study was a prospective cohort of CD and UC patients recruited from a tertiary\
  \ referral center. All patients underwent genotyping on the Illumina Immunochip.\
  \ A genetic risk score (GRS) incorporating strength of association (log odds ratio)\
  \ and allele dose for each of the 163 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) risk loci\
  \ was calculated and phenotypic associations examined across GRS quartiles. RESULTS:\
  \ Our study cohort included 1,105 patients (697 CD, 408 UC). Increasing genetic\
  \ burden was associated with earlier age of diagnosis of CD (Ptrend=0.008). Patients\
  \ in the highest GRS quartile were likely to develop disease 5 years earlier than\
  \ those in the lowest quartile. Increasing genetic burden was also associated with\
  \ ileal involvement in CD (Ptrend textless0.0001). The effect of genetic burden\
  \ was independent of the NOD2 locus and was stronger among those with no NOD2 variants,\
  \ and in never smokers. UC patients with an involved first-degree relative had a\
  \ higher genetic burden, but GRS was not associated with disease phenotype in UC.\
  \ CONCLUSIONS: Increasing genetic burden is associated with early age of diagnosis\
  \ in CD, but not UC. The expanded panel of IBD risk loci explains only a fraction\
  \ of variance of disease phenotype, suggesting limited clinical utility of genetics\
  \ in predicting natural history."
