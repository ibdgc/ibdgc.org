abstract: "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Variants in the tumor necrosis factor superfamily member\
  \ 15 gene (TNFSF15, also called TL1A) have been associated with risk for inflammatory\
  \ bowel disease (IBD). TL1A affects expression of multiple cytokines to promote\
  \ mucosal inflammation. Little is known about the TL1A-response pathways that regulate\
  \ cytokine expression. We investigated T-cell gene expression patterns to determine\
  \ the mechanisms by which TL1A regulates cytokine production, and whether these\
  \ associate with outcomes of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Peripheral\
  \ T cells isolated from normal donors were cultured with TL1A. We performed gene\
  \ expression profile analysis by RNA sequencing of subsets of interferon gamma (IFNG)-producing\
  \ and non-producing cells purified by flow cytometry. Unsupervised hierarchical\
  \ clustering analysis was used to identify gene expression differences between these\
  \ subsets. Ribonuclease T2 gene (RNASET2) expression and methylation were assessed\
  \ by quantitative trait loci analyses. Clinical characteristics of patients (complications,\
  \ resistance to therapy, and recurrence time) were associated with single nucleotide\
  \ polymorphisms in RNASET2. We performed motif screening to identify polymorphisms\
  \ that disrupt transcription factor binding sites. Levels of RNASET2 were knocked\
  \ down with small interfering RNA in CD4+ T cells and the effect on protein expression\
  \ was determined by proteomic analysis and cytokine production. Cell aggregation\
  \ was measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: We identified 764 genes with at least\
  \ a 2-fold difference in TL1A-mediated expression between IFNG-secreting and non-secreting\
  \ T cells (P textless 1 × 10-5). Many of these genes were located near IBD susceptibility\
  \ variants. RNASET2 was the only IBD risk-associated gene with textgreater5-fold\
  \ down-regulation in the IFNG-secreting subset. RNASET2 disease risk variants were\
  \ associated with decreased expression in peripheral and mucosal tissues and DNA\
  \ hypermethylation in CD patients requiring surgical intervention. RNASET2 disease\
  \ risk variants were associated in CD patients with more complicated disease or\
  \ resistance to therapy, defined in part by failed response to treatment, increased\
  \ length of intestinal resection, shorter time to repeat surgery, and high Rutgeerts\
  \ score (textgreater2) in postoperative endoscopy. The RNASET2 variant rs2149092\
  \ was predicted to disrupt a consensus binding site for the transcription factor\
  \ ETS within an enhancer region. Expression of RNASET2 correlated with expression\
  \ of ETS. RNASET2 knockdown in T cells increased expression of IFNG and intercellular\
  \ adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) and induced T-cell aggregation. A blocking antibody\
  \ against (ILFA1), disrupting the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1-intercellular\
  \ adhesion molecule 1 interaction, reduced T-cell production of IFNG. CONCLUSIONS:\
  \ We identified decreased expression of RNASET2 as a component of TL1A-mediated\
  \ increase in production of IFNG and as a potential biomarker for patients with\
  \ severe CD. Further study of the role of RNASET2 in regulating mucosal inflammation\
  \ may lead to development of novel therapeutic targets."
