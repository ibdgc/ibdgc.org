abstract: "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified\
  \ 140 Crohn's disease (CD) susceptibility loci. For most loci, the variants that\
  \ cause  disease are not known and the genes affected by these variants have not\
  \ been identified. We aimed to identify variants that cause CD through detailed\
  \ sequencing, genetic association, expression, and functional studies. METHODS:\
  \ We  sequenced whole exomes of 42 unrelated subjects with CD and 5 healthy subjects\
  \ (controls) and then filtered single nucleotide variants by incorporating association\
  \ results from meta-analyses of CD GWAS and in silico mutation effect prediction\
  \ algorithms. We then genotyped 9348 subjects with CD, 2868 subjects with ulcerative\
  \ colitis, and 14,567 control subjects and associated variants analyzed in functional\
  \ studies using materials from subjects and controls and in  vitro model systems.\
  \ RESULTS: We identified rare missense mutations in PR domain-containing 1 (PRDM1)\
  \ and associated these with CD. These mutations increased proliferation of T cells\
  \ and secretion of cytokines on activation and increased expression of the adhesion\
  \ molecule L-selectin. A common CD risk allele, identified in GWAS, correlated with\
  \ reduced expression of PRDM1 in ileal  biopsy specimens and peripheral blood mononuclear\
  \ cells (combined P = 1.6 x 10(-8)). We identified an association between CD and\
  \ a common missense variant, Val248Ala, in nuclear domain 10 protein 52 (NDP52)\
  \ (P = 4.83 x 10(-9)). We found  that this variant impairs the regulatory functions\
  \ of NDP52 to inhibit nuclear factor kappaB activation of genes that regulate inflammation\
  \ and affect the stability of proteins in Toll-like receptor pathways. CONCLUSIONS:\
  \ We have extended the results of GWAS and provide evidence that variants in PRDM1\
  \ and NDP52 determine susceptibility to CD. PRDM1 maps adjacent to a CD interval\
  \ identified in GWAS and encodes a transcription factor expressed by T and B cells.\
  \ NDP52 is an adaptor protein that functions in selective autophagy of intracellular\
  \ bacteria and signaling molecules, supporting the role of autophagy  in the pathogenesis\
  \ of CD."
