abstract: Given the recent explosion of genetic discoveries, 2007 is becoming known
  to human geneticists as the year of genome-wide association studies. In fact, more
  genetic risk factors for common diseases were identified in this one year than had
  been collectively reported before 2007. In particular, 2007 witnessed the discovery
  of many genes that influence susceptibility to individual immune-mediated diseases,
  as well as other genes that are associated with susceptibility to more than one
  disease. Although much work remains to be done, in this Review we discuss what effect
  these studies are having on our understanding of disease pathogenesis and their
  potential impact on future immunology studies.
