The long-term purpose of this study is to increase knowledge about IBD to better understand its causes and improve diagnosis, treatment, or even prevention. The immediate objective is to gain further understanding of the mechanisms involved in the susceptibility to and flare of inflammation in UC patients, by evaluating the genetic, microbial, gene expression and serological factors associated with mucosal inflammation. For this study, we will collect mucosal lavage (a solution which bathes the mucosal surface), mucosal biopsy (a small piece of tissue taken from the mucosal surface), blood, saliva, and stool samples from UC individuals. For mucosal lavage, saliva, and stool samples, microbial studies will be carried out to identify the bacteria associated with IBD. Additional studies will be carried out to understand the interaction between the bacteria and the host.

We believe the information we get from this project will help understand the role of intestinal bacteria in UC initiation and development, identify the specific bacteria, metabolites, and proteins associated with UC, and how the host effectively responds as a whole.

This study is closed to new recruitment.
