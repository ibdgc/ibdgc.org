abstract: "OBJECTIVE: The NOX2 NADPH oxidase complex produces reactive oxygen species\
  \ and plays a critical role in the killing of microbes by phagocytes. Genetic mutations\
  \ in genes encoding components of the complex result in both X-linked and autosomal\
  \ recessive forms of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Patients with CGD often\
  \ develop intestinal inflammation that is histologically similar to Crohn's colitis,\
  \ suggesting a common aetiology for both diseases. The aim of this study is to determine\
  \ if polymorphisms in NOX2 NADPH oxidase complex genes that do not  cause CGD are\
  \ associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS:\
  \ Direct sequencing and candidate gene approaches were used to identify susceptibility\
  \ loci in NADPH oxidase complex genes. Functional studies were carried out on identified\
  \ variants. Novel findings were replicated in independent cohorts. RESULTS: Sequence\
  \ analysis identified a novel missense variant in the neutrophil cytosolic factor\
  \ 2 (NCF2) gene that is associated with  very early onset IBD (VEO-IBD) and subsequently\
  \ found in 4% of patients with"
