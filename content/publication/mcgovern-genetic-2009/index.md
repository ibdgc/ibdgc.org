abstract: "BACKGROUND: The IL23/IL17 pathway is pivotal in the development of chronic\
  \ mucosal inflammation seen in Crohn's disease (CD). Genetic variants in the IL23R\
  \ and IL12B have been associated with CD susceptibility. We investigated 10 genes\
  \ within the IL23/IL17 pathway in a case-control study of 763 CD cases and 254 healthy\
  \ controls. METHODS: We identified a novel association in haplotypes in IL17A (empirical\
  \ P = 0.02), IL17RA (P = 0.001), IL17RD (P = 0.001), IL12RB1 (P = 0.003), and IL12RB2\
  \ (P = 0.001) as well as confirming the association with IL12B variants (P = 0.003).\
  \ RESULTS: The cumulative risk for carrying an increased number of CD risk haplotypes\
  \ from genes in this pathway rises to an odds ratio of 4.3 for carrying 5 risk haplotypes.\
  \ We have previously demonstrated an association between this cohort and IL23R haplotypes.\
  \ Pairwise analyses suggest that there is statistical interaction between variants\
  \ in IL17A and IL23R (P = 0.047) and between variants in IL17RA and IL23R (P = 0.036).\
  \ Furthermore, a significant association between CD and the widely replicated IL23R\
  \ variants is only seen in the presence of IL17A or IL17RA variants. CONCLUSIONS:\
  \ These data support the investigation of pathways implicated in CD pathogenesis\
  \ in order to identify further susceptibility genes and also suggest that important\
  \ gene-gene interaction is present in CD susceptibility.(Inflamm Bowel Dis 2009)."
