abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Genetic risk scores (GRS) have been developed that differentiate
  individuals with type 1 diabetes from those with other forms of diabetes and are
  starting to be used for population screening; however, most studies were conducted
  in European-ancestry populations. This study identifies novel genetic variants associated
  with type 1 diabetes risk in African-ancestry participants and develops an African-specific
  GRS. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We generated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
  data with the ImmunoChip on 1,021 African-ancestry participants with type 1 diabetes
  and 2,928 control participants. HLA class I and class II alleles were imputed using
  SNP2HLA. Logistic regression models were used to identify genome-wide significant
  (P textless 5.0 × 10-8) SNPs associated with type 1 diabetes in the African-ancestry
  samples and validate SNPs associated with risk in known European-ancestry loci (P
  textless 2.79 × 10-5). RESULTS: African-specific (HLA-DQA1*03:01-HLA-DQB1*02:01)
  and known European-ancestry HLA haplotypes (HLA-DRB1*03:01-HLA-DQA1*05:01-HLA-DQB1*02:01,
  HLA-DRB1*04:01-HLA-DQA1*03:01-HLA-DQB1*03:02) were significantly associated with
  type 1 diabetes risk. Among European-ancestry defined non-HLA risk loci, six risk
  loci were significantly associated with type 1 diabetes in subjects of African ancestry.
  An African-specific GRS provided strong prediction of type 1 diabetes risk (area
  under the curve 0.871), performing significantly better than a European-based GRS
  and two polygenic risk scores in independent discovery and validation cohorts. CONCLUSIONS:
  Genetic risk of type 1 diabetes includes ancestry-specific, disease-associated variants.
  The GRS developed here provides improved prediction of type 1 diabetes in African-ancestry
  subjects and a means to identify groups of individuals who would benefit from immune
  monitoring for early detection of islet autoimmunity.'
