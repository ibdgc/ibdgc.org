abstract: TL1A contributes to the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory diseases,
  including those of the bowel by enhancing TH1, TH17, and TH2 responses. TL1A mediates
  a strong costimulation of these TH subsets, particularly of mucosal CCR9+ T cells.
  However, the signaling pathways that TL1A induces in different TH subsets are incompletely
  understood. We investigated the function of TL1A on human TH17 cells. TL1A, together
  with TGF-β, IL-6, and IL-23, enhanced the secretion of IL-17 and IFN-γ from human
  CD4+ memory T cells. TL1A induced expression of the transcription factors BATF and
  T-bet that correlated with the secretion of IL-17 and IFN-γ. In contrast, TL1A alone
  induced high levels of IL-22 in memory CD4+ T cells and committed TH17 cells. However,
  TL1A did not enhance expression of IL-17A in TH17 cells. Expression of the transcription
  factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which regulates the expression of IL-22 was not
  affected by TL1A. Transcriptome analysis of TH17 cells revealed increased expression
  of IL-9 in response to TL1A. Blocking IL-9 receptor antibodies abrogated TL1A-induced
  IL-22 secretion. Furthermore, TL1A increased IL-9 production by peripheral TH17
  cells isolated from patients with Crohn's disease. These data suggest that TL1A
  differentially induces expression of TH17 effector cytokines IL-17, -9, and -22
  and provides a potential target for therapeutic intervention in TH17-driven chronic
  inflammatory diseases.
