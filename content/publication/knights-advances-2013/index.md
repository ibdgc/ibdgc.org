abstract: Studies of the genetics underlying inflammatory bowel diseases have increased
  our understanding of the pathways involved in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
  disease and focused attention on the role of the microbiome in these diseases. Full
  understanding of pathogenesis will require a comprehensive grasp of the delicate
  homeostasis between gut bacteria and the human host. In this review, we present
  current evidence of microbiome-gene interactions in the context of other known risk
  factors and mechanisms, and describe the next steps necessary to pair genetic variant
  and microbiome sequencing data from patient cohorts. We discuss the concept of dysbiosis,
  proposing that the functional composition of the gut microbiome may provide a more
  consistent definition of dysbiosis and may more readily provide evidence of genome-microbiome
  interactions in future exploratory studies.
