abstract: 'The goal of this work was to develop a label-free, comprehensive, and reproducible
  high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based untargeted
  lipidomic workflow using a single instrument, which could be applied to biomarker
  discovery in both basic and clinical studies. For this, we have (i) optimized lipid
  extraction and elution to enhance coverage of polar and nonpolar lipids as well
  as resolution of their isomers, (ii) ensured MS signal reproducibility and linearity,
  and (iii) developed a bioinformatic pipeline to correct remaining biases. Workflow
  validation is reported for 48 replicates of a single human plasma sample: 1124 reproducible
  LC-MS signals were extracted (median signal intensity RSD = 10%), 50% of which are
  redundant due to adducts, dimers, in-source fragmentation, contaminations, or positive
  and negative ion duplicates. From the resulting 578 unique compounds, 428 lipids
  were identified by MS/MS, including acyl chain composition, of which 394 had RSD
  textless 30% inside their linear intensity range, thereby enabling robust semiquantitation.
  MS signal intensity spanned 4 orders of magnitude, covering 16 lipid subclasses.
  Finally, the power of our workflow is illustrated by a proof-of-concept study in
  which 100 samples from healthy human subjects were analyzed and the data set was
  investigated using three different statistical testing strategies in order to compare
  their capacity in identifying the impact of sex and age on circulating lipids.'
