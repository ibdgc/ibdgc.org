abstract: "BACKGROUND: Current instruments used to measure disease activity and health-related\
  \ quality of life in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)\
  \ are often cumbersome, time-consuming, and expensive; although used in clinical\
  \ trials, they are not convenient for clinical practice. A numeric rating scale\
  \ (NRS) is a quick, inexpensive, and convenient patient-reported outcome that can\
  \ capture the patient's overall perception of health. AIMS: The aim of this study\
  \ was to assess the validity, reliability, and responsiveness of an NRS and evaluate\
  \ its use in clinical practice in patients with CD and UC. METHODS: We prospectively\
  \ evaluated patient-reported NRS scores and measured correlations between NRS and\
  \ a range of severity measures, including physician-reported NRS, Crohn's disease\
  \ activity index (CDAI), Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI), inflammatory bowel disease\
  \ questionnaire (IBDQ), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients with CD. Subsequently,\
  \ we evaluated the correlation between the NRS and standard measures of health status\
  \ (HBI or simple colitis clinical activity index [SCCAI]) and laboratory tests (sedimentation\
  \ rate [ESR], CRP, and fecal calprotectin) in patients with CD and UC. RESULTS:\
  \ The patient-reported NRS showed excellent correlation with CDAI (R (2) = 0.59,\
  \ p textless 0.0001), IBDQ (R (2) = 0.66, p textless 0.0001), and HBI (R (2) = 0.32,\
  \ p textless 0.0001) in patients with CD. The NRS showed poor, but statistically\
  \ significant correlation with SCCAI (R (2) = 0.25, p textless 0.0001) in patients\
  \ with UC. The NRS did not correlate with CRP, ESR, or calprotectin. The NRS was\
  \ reliable and responsive to change. CONCLUSIONS: The NRS is a valid, reliable,\
  \ and responsive measure that may be useful to evaluate patients with CD and possibly\
  \ UC."
