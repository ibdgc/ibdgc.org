abstract: "BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are inflammatory\
  \ bowel diseases (IBDs) presumably caused by dysregulated immune responses to the\
  \ gut microbiota. Genetic association studies have implicated dozens of chromosomal\
  \ regions or loci in IBD susceptibility. The next challenge is to explain the individual\
  \ role of each of these modest effect loci in the disease state. We have previously\
  \ identified MAST3 as an IBD susceptibility gene through genetic fine-mapping of\
  \ the 19p linkage region. Testing MAST3 in a reporter assay provided preliminary\
  \ evidence that MAST3 modulates the activity of inflammation-related transcription\
  \ factor nuclear factor kappa B. METHODS: Here we characterized the function of\
  \ MAST3 through an examination of the influence of the modulation of MAST3 expression\
  \ on endogenous genome-wide expression patterns. More specifically, we looked at\
  \ differential gene expression resulting from overexpression and knockdown of the\
  \ MAST3 gene in epithelial and macrophage cell lines. From we highlight a group\
  \ of genes whose expression is modulated by MAST3 and correlate their expression\
  \ with NF-jB activity. Their expression was found to be enriched in inflamed mucosal\
  \ tissue of UC patients, confirming the importance of these genes in IBD. RESULTS:\
  \ We highlight a group of genes whose expression is modulated by MAST3 and correlate\
  \ their expression with NF-κB activity. Their expression was found to be enriched\
  \ in inflamed mucosal tissue of UC patients, confirming the importance of these\
  \ genes in IBD. These MAST3-regulated genes are central to mucosal immune responses.\
  \ Among them are proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., CCL20, IL8), regulators of NF-κB\
  \ (e.g., TNFAIP3, LY96, NFKBIA), genes involved in interferon-induced defense against\
  \ pathogen invasion (e.g., IFIT1, ISG15), and genes involved in cell adhesion and/or\
  \ migration (e.g., CD44, TMOD1). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results confirm\
  \ MAST3 as a modulator of the inflammatory response through regulation of immune\
  \ gene expression in the gut of IBD patients."
