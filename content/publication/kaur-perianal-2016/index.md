abstract: "BACKGROUND: Perianal Crohn's Disease (pCD) is a particularly severe phenotype\
  \ associated with poor quality of life with a reported prevalence of 12%-40%. Previous\
  \ studies investigating the etiology of pCD have been limited in the numbers of\
  \ subjects and the intensity of genotyping. The aim of this study was to identify\
  \ clinical, serological, and genetic factors associated with pCD. METHODS: We performed\
  \ a case-control study comparing patients with (pCD+) and without perianal (pCD)\
  \ involvement in CD; defined as the presence of perianal abscesses or fistulae.\
  \ Data on demographics and clinical features were obtained by chart review. Inflammatory\
  \ bowel disease-related serology was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\
  \ Genetic data were generated using Illumina genotyping platforms. RESULTS: We included\
  \ 1721 patients with CD of which 524 (30.4%) were pCD+ and 1197 were pPCD. pCD was\
  \ associated with distal colonic disease (Odds ratio 5.54 [3.23-9.52], P textless\
  \ 0.001), stricturing disease behavior (1.44 [1.14-1.81], P = 0.002) and family\
  \ history of inflammatory bowel disease (4.98 [3.30-7.46], P textless 0.001). pCD\
  \ was associated with higher anti-sacharomyces cerevisae antibodies IgA (P textless\
  \ 0.001) and OmpC (P = 0.008) antibody levels. pCD was associated with known inflammatory\
  \ bowel disease loci, including KIF3B, CRTC3, TRAF3IP2, JAZF1, NRIP1, MST1, FUT2,\
  \ and PTGER (all P textless 0.05). We also identified genetic association with genes\
  \ involved in autophagy (DAPK1, P = 5.11 × 10), TNF alpha pathways (NUCB2, P = 8.68\
  \ × 10; DAPK1), IFNg pathways (DAPK1; NDFIP2, P = 8.74 × 10), and extracellular\
  \ matrix and scaffolding proteins (USH1C, P = 8.68 × 10; NDFIP2; TMC07, P = 8.87\
  \ × 10). Pathway analyses implicated the JAK-Stat pathway (pc = 3.72 × 10). CONCLUSION:\
  \ We have identified associations between pCD, more distal colonic inflammation,\
  \ Crohn's disease-associated serologies, and genetic variation in the JAK-Stat pathway."
