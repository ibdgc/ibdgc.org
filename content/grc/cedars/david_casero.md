Dr. David Casero, PhD, develops and applies computational methods for the analyses of high-throughput multi-omics data. His lab aims to bridge the gap between traditional approaches where one type of omics data provides a snapshot into potential disease biomarkers and current multi-omics efforts that can provide information into the actual drivers of disease. The Casero Lab is particularly interested on the establishment and maintenance of normal tissue homeostasis, supported by molecular interactions between members of the tissue microenvironment (e.g., epithelial, mesenchymal and immune cells) and additional factors (e.g., signals from microbial cells). A proper understanding of these interactions is instrumental to gain insights into the etiology of some complex diseases like Inflammatory Bowel Disease and cancer.
