abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are
  chronic immunologically mediated diseases of the gut. Advances in genetics have
  revolutionized our understanding of the pathogenesis of these conditions with 163
  risk loci identified, encompassing a variety of immunologic functions. There is
  substantial heterogeneity in the natural history of these diseases with respect
  to disease onset, course, and progression to complications. There are also significant
  variations in response to therapies and susceptibility to therapy-related and disease-related
  complications. An important need in the field is to identify predictors of disease
  course, complications, and likelihood of response and adverse events to allow for
  targeted therapeutic decision making. The genotype of an individual in constant
  and non-modifiable, and thus could potentially fulfill the role of important predictors
  of these outcomes. In this review, we discuss the existing literature on the prediction
  of various disease phenotypes in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis using underlying
  genotype. We also identify gaps in the literature and suggest future directions
  for research. There is need for large, multi-institutional, and international collaborative
  consortia with efficient and detailed cohort accrual, phenotypic definition, genotyping,
  and dynamic assessments of external (e.g., diet) and internal (microbiome) environment
  to allow us to progress toward personalized and precision medicine in the management
  of these complex diseases.
