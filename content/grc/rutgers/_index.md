# GRC Abstract

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
(UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major
health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in
dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 200 IBD loci by
genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of
European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to
facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers
(GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our particular focus
as a GRC is African American (AA) IBD genetics. We performed the first
large-scale evaluation of European loci in the AA population, replicating
several genes, but also finding unique African-ancestral variants within these
loci, as well as identified multiple admixture significant loci. We also
published the first AA IBD genome-wide association study (GWAS), a
collaborative effort that identified two African-specific gene loci, and
replicated multiple additional European loci. We have also explored why some
loci with proven risk variants in Europeans and other populations only cause
disease in one ancestral population but not others. More research in AA IBD is
needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major
American population.

In this application we will re-evaluate the AA GWAS by better imputation,
evaluate whole genome sequencing data to test low frequency and rare variants,
and perform an evaluation for chromosome X variants. We will recruit a large
number of AA IBD patients through our own and multiple Satellite Recruitment
Centers to power a second AA IBD GWAS, both UC and CD, and meta-analyze with
the first to identify more novel loci, identify more African specific risk
variants, and replicate known loci for this population and replicate our
admixture loci. We will also incorporate diverse data sources to incorporate
into our GWAS analyses including RNA-Seq currently being generated on
lymophoblastoid cell lines from AA CD cases and controls, and RNA-Seq that we
will generate in colonic biopsies from UC cases and controls. We will evaluate
chromatin differences and expression of genes in cell types relevant to IBD
from European, AA and East Asian ancestries in an effort to better understand
locus heterogeneity by ancestry. We will continue to participate in all IBDGC
activities to maximize the Impact of IBD genetics research by this cooperative
funding mechanism.

1. Ravit Boger, PI, R21DK119989; Medical College of Wisconsin, “Contribution
   of Cytomegalovirus to Crohn’s disease complications and recurrences.” The
   objective of this project is to investigate the contribution of CMV to the
   natural history of Crohn’s disease, especially in different NOD2 genetic
   backgrounds

2. Karen Edelblum, R21DK123488, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, “Profiling
   of intraepithelial lymphocyte populations in health and Crohn’s Disease.”
   The goal of this project is to leverage advances in single-cell RNA
   sequencing technology and RNA imaging to profile the phenotypic and
   functional characteristics of ileal IEL subpopulations in health and acute
   Crohn’s disease.
