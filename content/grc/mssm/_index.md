bio: ["My major research efforts currently are: a) defining mechanisms of stromal/epithelial/myeloid cell cross talk in IBD; b) predicting differences in clinical outcomes of interest across IBD clinical subtypes and populations; c) exploring the role of rare, IBD-associated variants of high effects; and d) developing new treatment targets based on IBD genetic and single cell expression findings. The explosion of data and new data tools that are accelerating collaborative efforts to benefit patients through genetic and genomic studies; applying new data and technology approaches will broadly benefit the NIDDK IBDGC."]

### NIDDK IBDGC-related goals

#### Specific Aims

**Aim 1:** To define cellular and genetic mechanisms of perianal fistulous rectal Crohn's disease via direct ex-vivo, single cell multi-omics in African-American and European ancestry patients.

**Aim 2:** To model differentiation branch points of pluripotent intestinal epithelial stem cells and blood monocytes via multiomic, serial single cell analyses.

**Aim 3:** Across the NIDDK IBDGC, to enhance power for genetic discovery and improved prediction in African-American and Hispanic cohorts and in hospitalized ulcerative colitis flares.

#### Additional resources at Mount Sinai

- BioMe cohort: Dr. Cho accesses the School’s blood-based biobank containing over 60K patients, for whom 30K have attained whole exome sequence data
- MSCCR (Mount Sinai Crohn’s and Colitis Registry): under the leadership of Dr. Sands, the MSCCR cohort contains over 1500 IBD patients for whom RNASeq are attained, with whole exome sequencing and chip data pending (ongoing at the Broad Institute, for full NIH-sharing)
- Radiology de-identification: The Imaging Institute at Mount Sinai has the capacity to de-identify all personal health identifiers from DICOM-attained radiology images.
- Pathology biobank: Mount Sinai is digitizing many of the clinical samples which provide a valuable new datatype for NIDDK IBDGC patients
