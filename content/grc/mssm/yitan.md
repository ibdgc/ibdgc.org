Dr. Yuval Itan is an Assistant Professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at
Mount Sinai. He is an expert in human disease genomics and computational
biology. The laboratory of Dr. Itan is conducting research in the following
main topics: (1) development of computational methods for identifying novel
disease-causing mutations and genes in next generation sequencing (NGS) data
by cutting-edge machine learning and statistical approaches; and (2)
cases-controls NGS analyses for identifying the genetic etiologies of human
diseases, in particular IBD, primary immunodeficiencies and congenital heart
disease. Dr. Itan is currently leading an NIDDK IBDGC research project of
identifying rare and high-impact new IBD mutations, genes and pathways in
whole exome sequencing data of Ashkenazi Jewish patients and unaffected
controls.
