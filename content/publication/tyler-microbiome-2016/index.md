abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease has been associated with differential abundance
  of numerous organisms when compared to healthy controls (HCs); however, few studies
  have investigated variability in the microbiome across intestinal locations and
  how this variability might be related to disease location and phenotype. In this
  study, we have analyzed the microbiome of a large cohort of individuals recruited
  at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, Canada. Biopsies were taken from subjects with
  Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and HC, and also individuals having undergone
  ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for treatment of ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous
  polyposis. Microbial 16S rRNA was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. We
  observed a great deal of variability in the microbiome characterizing different
  sampling locations. Samples from pouch and afferent limb were comparable in microbial
  composition. When comparing sigmoid and terminal ileum samples, more differences
  were observed. The greatest number of differentially abundant microbes was observed
  when comparing either pouch or afferent limb samples to sigmoid or terminal ileum.
  Despite these differences, we were able to observe modest microbial variability
  between inflammatory bowel disease phenotypes and HCs, even when controlling for
  sampling location and additional experimental factors. Most detected associations
  were observed between HCs and Crohn's disease, with decreases in specific genera
  in the families Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae characterizing tissue samples
  from individuals with Crohn's disease. This study highlights important considerations
  when analyzing the composition of the microbiome and also provides useful insight
  into differences in the microbiome characterizing these seemingly related phenotypes.
