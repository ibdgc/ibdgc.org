abstract: Genome-wide association studies and follow-up meta-analyses in Crohn's disease
  (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have recently identified 163 disease-associated
  loci that meet genome-wide significance for these two inflammatory bowel diseases
  (IBD). These discoveries have already had a tremendous impact on our understanding
  of the genetic architecture of these diseases and have directed functional studies
  that have revealed some of the biological functions that are important to IBD (e.g.
  autophagy). Nonetheless, these loci can only explain a small proportion of disease
  variance (~14% in CD and 7.5% in UC), suggesting that not only are additional loci
  to be found but that the known loci may contain high effect rare risk variants that
  have gone undetected by GWAS. To test this, we have used a targeted sequencing approach
  in 200 UC cases and 150 healthy controls (HC), all of French Canadian descent, to
  study 55 genes in regions associated with UC. We performed follow-up genotyping
  of 42 rare non-synonymous variants in independent case-control cohorts (totaling
  14,435 UC cases and 20,204 HC). Our results confirmed significant association to
  rare non-synonymous coding variants in both IL23R and CARD9, previously identified
  from sequencing of CD loci, as well as identified a novel association in RNF186.
  With the exception of CARD9 (OR = 0.39), the rare non-synonymous variants identified
  were of moderate effect (OR = 1.49 for RNF186 and OR = 0.79 for IL23R). RNF186 encodes
  a protein with a RING domain having predicted E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity
  and two transmembrane domains. Importantly, the disease-coding variant is located
  in the ubiquitin ligase domain. Finally, our results suggest that rare variants
  in genes identified by genome-wide association in UC are unlikely to contribute
  significantly to the overall variance for the disease. Rather, these are expected
  to help focus functional studies of the corresponding disease loci.
