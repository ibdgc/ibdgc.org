abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Approximately 80% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC)
  have intermittently active disease and up to 20% will require a colectomy, but little
  data available on predictors of poor disease course. The aim of this study was to
  identify clinical and genetic markers that can predict prognosis. METHODS: Medical
  records of patients with UC with â‰¥5 years of follow-up and available DNA and serum
  were retrospectively assessed. Immunochip was used to genotype loci associated with
  immune mediated inflammatory disorders (IMIDs), inflammatory bowel diseases, and
  other single nucleotide polypmorphisms previously associated with disease severity.
  Serum levels of pANCA, ASCA, CBir1, and OmpC were also evaluated. Requirement for
  colectomy, medication, and hospitalization were used to group patients into 3 prognostic
  groups. RESULTS: Six hundred one patients with UC were classified as mild (n = 78),
  moderate (n = 273), or severe disease (n = 250). Proximal disease location frequencies
  at diagnosis were 13%, 21%, and 30% for mild, moderate, and severe UC, respectively
  (P = 0.001). Disease severity was associated with greater proximal extension rates
  on follow-up (P textless 0.0001) and with shorter time to extension (P = 0.03) and
  to prednisone initiation (P = 0.0004). When comparing severe UC with mild and moderate
  UC together, diagnosis age textgreater40 and proximal disease location were associated
  with severe UC (odds ratios = 1.94 and 2.12, respectively). None of the single nucleotide
  polypmorphisms or serum markers tested was associated with severe UC, proximal disease
  extension or colectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Older age and proximal disease location at
  diagnosis, but not genetic and serum markers, were associated with a more severe
  course. Further work is required to identify biomarkers that will predict outcomes
  in UC.'
