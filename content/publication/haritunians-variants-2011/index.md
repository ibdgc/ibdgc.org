abstract: "OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple Crohn's\
  \ disease (CD) susceptibility loci, including association with non-coding intergenic\
  \ single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 10q21. DESIGN: To fine-map the 10q21\
  \ locus, the authors genotyped 86 SNPs in 1632 CD cases and 961 controls and performed\
  \ single-marker and conditional analyses using logistic regression. RESULTS: Association\
  \ with CD risk spanning 11 SNPs (ptextless0.001) was observed. The most significant\
  \ association observed was at the non-synonymous SNP, rs7076156 (Ala62Thr), in ZNF365.\
  \ The alanine allele was over-represented in CD (p=5.23×10⁻⁷; OR=1.39 (95% CI 1.22\
  \ to 1.58)); allele frequency of 76% in CD and 69.7% in controls). Conditional analysis\
  \ on rs7076156 nullified all other significant associations, suggesting that this\
  \ is the causative variant at this locus. Four isoforms of ZNF365 have previously\
  \ been identified, and rs7076156 is located in an exon unique to ZNF365 isoform\
  \ D. The authors demonstrated, using reverse transcription-PCR, expression of ZNF365D\
  \ in intestinal resections from both CD subjects and controls. Markedly reduced\
  \ mean expression levels of ZNF365D were identified in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed\
  \ lymphoblastoid cell lines from CD subjects homozygous for the risk allele (Ala).\
  \ A whole-genome microarray expression study further suggested that the Ala62Thr\
  \ change in ZNF365 isoform D is related to differential expression of the genes\
  \ ARL4A, MKKS, RRAGD, SUMF2, TDR1 and ZNF148 in CD. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these\
  \ data support the hypothesis that the non-synonymous Ala62Thr SNP, rs7076156, underlies\
  \ the association between 10q21 and CD risk and suggest that this SNP acts by altering\
  \ expression of genes under the control of ZNF365 isoform D."
