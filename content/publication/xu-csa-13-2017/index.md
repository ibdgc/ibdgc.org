abstract: Many Crohn's disease (CD) patients develop intestinal strictures, which
  are difficult to prevent and treat. Cationic steroid antimicrobial 13 (CSA13) shares
  cationic nature and antimicrobial function with antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin.
  As many functions of cathelicidin are mediated through formyl peptide receptor-like
  1 (FPRL1), we hypothesize that CSA13 mediates anti-fibrogenic effects via FPRL1.
  Human intestinal biopsies were used in clinical data analysis. Chronic trinitrobenzene
  sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis-associated intestinal fibrosis mouse model with the
  administration of CSA13 was used. Colonic FPRL1 mRNA expression was positively correlated
  with the histology scores of inflammatory bowel disease patients. In CD patients,
  colonic FPRL1 mRNA was positively correlated with intestinal stricture. CSA13 administration
  ameliorated intestinal fibrosis without influencing intestinal microbiota. Inhibition
  of FPRL1, but not suppression of intestinal microbiota, reversed these protective
  effects of CSA13. Metabolomic analysis indicated increased fecal mevalonate levels
  in the TNBS-treated mice, which were reduced by the CSA13 administration. CSA13
  inhibited colonic HMG-CoA reductase activity in an FPRL1-dependent manner. Mevalonate
  reversed the anti-fibrogenic effect of CSA13. The increased colonic FPRL1 expression
  is associated with severe mucosal disease activity and intestinal stricture. CSA13
  inhibits intestinal fibrosis via FPRL1-dependent modulation of HMG-CoA reductase
  pathway.
