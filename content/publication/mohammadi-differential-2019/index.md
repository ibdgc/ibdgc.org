abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key modulators of gene expression in Crohn's disease
  (CD) and may drive tissue-specific molecular alterations underlying CD susceptibility.
  In this study we analysed differential miRNA expression between CD and healthy subjects
  across ileal and colonic tissues. A cohort of CD and healthy control (HC) subjects
  was recruited and clinical data collected. Endoscopically quiescent CD (CDq) was
  defined as inactive or mild by the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD. Total RNA was
  extracted from endoscopic biopsies taken from the terminal ileum and sigmoid colon.
  miRNA expression was quantified using NanoString Technologies. Statistical significance
  was assessed across biopsy site and diagnosis per miRNA and corrected for multiple
  testing. In total, 23 CDq and 38 HC subjects were enrolled. 112 samples were included
  in the analysis, 51 from the ileum and 61 from the colon. We found 47 miRNAs differentially
  expressed by biopsy site in healthy tissue. Nine miRNAs were differentially expressed
  across HC and CDq accounting for biopsy location. One of these, miR-223-3p, showed
  age and sex effects. We identified miRNA expression driven by diagnosis targeting
  genes involved in chemokine and cytokine signalling. miR-31-5p expression was driven
  by location and may be a biomarker for location subtypes in CD. We identified differentially
  expressed miRNAs in healthy ileal and colonic tissues. We discovered spatial miRNA
  expression patterns in CD and HC suggesting site-specific regulation in subjects
  with no or minimal intestinal inflammation. These miRNAs target genes involved in
  immunoregulatory processes, suggesting a functional, tissue-specific role in CD.
