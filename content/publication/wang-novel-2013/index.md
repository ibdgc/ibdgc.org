abstract: "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have identified at least 71\
  \ Crohn's disease (CD) genetic risk loci, but the role of gene-gene interactions\
  \ is unclear. The value of genetic variants in clinical practice is not defined\
  \ because of limited explained heritability. METHODS: We examined model predictability\
  \ of combining the 71 CD risk alleles and genetic interactions in an ongoing inflammatory\
  \ bowel disease genome-wide association study. The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium\
  \ inflammatory bowel disease genome-wide association  study was used as a replicate\
  \ cohort. We used logic regression, an adaptive regression methodology, to search\
  \ for high-order binary predictors (e.g., single-nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] interactions).\
  \ RESULTS: The combined 71 CD SNPs had good CD risk predictability (area under the\
  \ curve of 0.75 and 0.73 in the 2 cohorts). Higher cumulative allele score predicted\
  \ higher CD risk, but a relatively small difference in cumulative allele scores\
  \ was observed between CD and controls (49 versus 47, P textless 0.001). Through\
  \ LR, we identified high-order genetic interactions and significantly improved the\
  \ model predictability (area under the curve, from 0.75 to 0.77, P textless 0.0001).\
  \ A genetic interaction model, including NOD2, ATG16L1, IL10/IL19, C13orf31, and\
  \ chr21q loci, was discovered and successfully replicated in the independent Wellcome\
  \ Trust Case Control Consortium cohort. The explained heritability of the 71 CD\
  \ SNPs alone was 24% and increased  to 27% after adding the genetic interactions.\
  \ CONCLUSIONS: A novel approach allowed the identification and replication of genetic\
  \ interactions among NOD2, ATG16L1, IL10/IL19, C13orf31, and chr21q loci. CD risk\
  \ can be predicted by a model of 71 CD loci and improved by adding genetic interactions."
