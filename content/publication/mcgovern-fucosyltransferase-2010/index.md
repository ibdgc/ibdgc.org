abstract: Genetic variation in both innate and adaptive immune systems is associated
  with Crohn's disease (CD) susceptibility, but much of the heritability to CD remains
  unknown. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 896 CD cases and
  3204 healthy controls all of Caucasian origin as defined by multidimensional scaling.
  We found supportive evidence for 21 out of 40 CD loci identified in a recent CD
  GWAS meta-analysis, including two loci which had only nominally achieved replication
  (rs4807569, 19p13; rs991804, CCL2/CCL7). In addition, we identified associations
  with genes involved in tight junctions/epithelial integrity (ASHL, ARPC1A), innate
  immunity (EXOC2), dendritic cell biology [CADM1 (IGSF4)], macrophage development
  (MMD2), TGF-beta signaling (MAP3K7IP1) and FUT2 (a physiological trait that regulates
  gastrointestinal mucosal expression of blood group A and B antigens) (rs602662,
  P=3.4x10(-5)). Twenty percent of Caucasians are 'non-secretors' who do not express
  ABO antigens in saliva as a result of the FUT2 W134X allele. We demonstrated replication
  in an independent cohort of 1174 CD cases and 357 controls between the four primary
  FUT2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CD (rs602662, combined P-value 4.90x10(-8))
  and also association with FUT2 W143X (P=2.6x10(-5)). Further evidence of the relevance
  of this locus to CD pathogenesis was demonstrated by the association of the original
  four SNPs and CD in the recently published CD GWAS meta-analysis (rs602662, P=0.001).
  These findings strongly implicate this locus in CD susceptibility and highlight
  the role of the mucus layer in the development of CD.
