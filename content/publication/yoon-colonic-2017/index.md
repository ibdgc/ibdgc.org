abstract: Background Although anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents are effective
  in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), many patients either do not respond
  to anti-TNF treatment or lose response over time. The aim of this study was to determine
  factors associated with response to anti-TNF therapy in IBD.  Methods Patients with
  Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis who had consented to participate in a
  genetics registry and been treated with anti-TNF agents were evaluated retrospectively
  and categorized as primary nonresponders or secondary nonresponders. We evaluated
  clinical, serological, and genetic characteristics associated with primary nonresponse
  or time to loss of response to anti-TNF agents.  Results We included 314 CD (51
  [16.2%] primary nonresponders and 179 [57.0%] secondary nonresponders) and 145 subjects
  with ulcerative colitis (43 [29.7%] primary nonresponders and 74 [51.0%] secondary
  nonresponders). Colonic involvement (P = 0.017; odds ratio = 8.0) and anti-TNF monotherapy
  (P = 0.017; odds ratio = 4.9) were associated in a multivariate analysis with primary
  nonresponse to anti-TNF agents in CD. In addition, higher anti–nuclear cytoplasmic
  antibody levels (P = 0.019; hazard ratio = 1.01) in CD, anti–nuclear cytoplasmic
  antibody positivity (P = 0.038; hazard ratio = 1.6) in ulcerative colitis, and a
  positive family history of IBD (P = 0.044; hazard ratio = 1.3) in all patients with
  IBD were associated with time to loss of response to anti-TNF agents. Furthermore,
  various known IBD susceptibility single-nucleotide polymorphisms and additional
  variants in immune-mediated genes were shown to be associated with primary nonresponse
  or time to loss of response.  Conclusions Our results may help to optimize the use
  of anti-TNF agents in clinical practice and position these therapies appropriately
  as clinicians strive for a more personalized approach to managing IBD.
