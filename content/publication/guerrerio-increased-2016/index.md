abstract: 'BACKGROUND: TGFβ is a multifunctional cytokine that is critical in regulating
  mucosal immunity. Murine studies have revealed that disruption of canonical TGFβ
  signaling leads to systemic inflammation including colitis. Loeys-Dietz syndrome
  (LDS) results from heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding the subunits of
  the TGFβ receptor. METHODS: All patients with confirmed mutations in TGFBR1 or TGFBR2,
  seen in the Johns Hopkins Connective Tissue Disorders clinic, were asked to participate
  in the study. Ninety-three consecutive patients were enrolled, including 4 with
  inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Using the Illumina Immunochip array, we undertook
  an exploratory analysis to evaluate the potential genetic risk factors that could
  predict which patients with LDS would develop IBD. RESULTS: We report an increased
  prevalence of IBD in patients with LDS types I and II. We describe the course of
  several patients. In this small sample, the 3 whites with IBD had a genetic risk
  score in the top 6 highest scores of patients evaluated. CONCLUSION: We report a
  10-fold increase in the prevalence of IBD in patients with LDS compared with the
  general population. Onset of disease in 3 of the 4 patients was at less than 18
  years, and the clinical course in 2 of the 4 was severe with a poor response to
  traditional medications. Further evaluation of the genetic risk score is needed
  to determine whether it can predict which patients with LDS are most likely to develop
  IBD. This case series of patients with LDS with IBD suggests that defective TGFβ
  signaling may have an influence on IBD risk.'
