abstract: It is suggested that subtyping of complex inflammatory diseases can be based
  on genetic susceptibility and relevant environmental exposure (G+E). We propose
  that using matched cellular phenotypes in human subjects and corresponding preclinical
  models with the same G+E combinations is useful to this end. As an example, defective
  Paneth cells can subtype Crohn's disease (CD) subjects; Paneth cell defects have
  been linked to multiple CD susceptibility genes and are associated with poor outcome.
  We hypothesized that CD susceptibility genes interact with cigarette smoking, a
  major CD environmental risk factor, to trigger Paneth cell defects. We found that
  both CD subjects and mice with ATG16L1T300A (T300A; a prevalent CD susceptibility
  allele) developed Paneth cell defects triggered by tobacco smoke. Transcriptional
  analysis of full-thickness ileum and Paneth cell-enriched crypt base cells showed
  the T300A-smoking combination altered distinct pathways, including proapoptosis,
  metabolic dysregulation, and selective downregulation of the PPARγ pathway. Pharmacologic
  intervention by either apoptosis inhibitor or PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone prevented
  smoking-induced crypt apoptosis and Paneth cell defects in T300A mice and mice with
  conditional Paneth cell-specific knockout of Atg16l1. This study demonstrates how
  explicit G+E can drive disease-relevant phenotype and provides rational strategies
  for identifying actionable targets.
