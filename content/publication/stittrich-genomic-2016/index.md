abstract: Currently, the best clinical predictor for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
  is family history. Over 163 sequence variants have been associated with IBD in genome-wide
  association studies, but they have weak effects and explain only a fraction of the
  observed heritability. It is expected that additional variants contribute to the
  genomic architecture of IBD, possibly including rare variants with effect sizes
  larger than the identified common variants. Here we applied a family study design
  and sequenced 38 individuals from five families, under the hypothesis that families
  with multiple IBD-affected individuals harbor one or more risk variants that (i)
  are shared among affected family members, (ii) are rare and (iii) have substantial
  effect on disease development. Our analysis revealed not only novel candidate risk
  variants but also high polygenic risk scores for common known risk variants in four
  out of the five families. Functional analysis of our top novel variant in the remaining
  family, a rare missense mutation in the ubiquitin ligase TRIM11, suggests that it
  leads to increased nuclear factor of kappa light chain enhancer in B-cells (NF-kappaB)
  signaling. We conclude that an accumulation of common weak-effect variants accounts
  for the high incidence of IBD in most, but not all families we analyzed  and that
  a family study design can identify novel rare variants conferring risk for IBD with
  potentially large effect size, such as the TRIM11 p.H414Y mutation.
