Dr. Vujkovic-Cvijin studies how microbes that inhabit the human gut contribute to immune-related diseases including inflammatory bowel disease. His work pioneered the study of gut bacteria in HIV disease progression and has helped define best practices for the investigation of gut microbial communities across human diseases. Dr. Vujkovic-Cvijin's research group uses microbiology, immunology, ecology, and data science to carry out translational work with the end-goal of impacting human health through harnessing the host-microbiota relationship.
