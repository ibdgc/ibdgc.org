abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Avascular necrosis (AVN) is associated with significant morbidity
  potentially causing severe pain and disability; patients with inflammatory bowel
  disease (IBD) have a higher prevalence of AVN compared with non-IBD populations.
  The purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of AVN in our IBD population
  and to evaluate these subjects for the presence of clinical characteristics associated
  with AVN on computed tomography (CT) imaging. METHODS: In 1313 IBD patients with
  abdomen/pelvis CT scans, we identified 27 patients (2.1%) with CT findings consistent
  with AVN. Through historical chart review, we confirmed that most patients had prior
  exposure to steroids, although 2 patients had no documented steroid exposure at
  all. RESULTS: We found that 59% of the concurrent radiology reports did not comment
  on the presence of AVN, suggesting that incidental CT findings of AVN among IBD
  patients are likely underreported. Notably, we found that 63% of these cases had
  documented complaints of low-back and/or hip pain. Using logistic regression, we
  found an association between anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive status
  across IBD (p = 0.007) and a smoking history in Crohn disease (p = 0.03) with the
  presence of AVN. CONCLUSIONS: We found that a significant proportion of IBD patients
  with AVN are reported in their records as having hip or low-back pain, and review
  of CT imaging under dedicated bone windows may identify AVN among this population.
  Our findings also suggest that additional etiological factors, beyond corticosteroids,
  contribute to the development of AVN in IBD. Further investigation is warranted
  regarding the mechanisms associated with AVN in IBD.'
