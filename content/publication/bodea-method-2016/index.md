abstract: One goal of human genetics is to understand the genetic basis of disease,
  a challenge for diseases of complex inheritance because risk alleles are few relative
  to the vast set of benign variants. Risk variants are often sought by association
  studies in which allele frequencies in case subjects are contrasted with those from
  population-based samples used as control subjects. In an ideal world we would know
  population-level allele frequencies, releasing researchers to focus on case subjects.
  We argue this ideal is possible, at least theoretically,  and we outline a path
  to achieving it in reality. If such a resource were to exist, it would yield ample
  savings and would facilitate the effective use of data repositories by removing
  administrative and technical barriers. We call this concept the Universal Control
  Repository Network (UNICORN), a means to perform association analyses without necessitating
  direct access to individual-level control data. Our approach to UNICORN uses existing
  genetic resources and various statistical tools to analyze these data, including
  hierarchical clustering with spectral analysis of ancestry; and empirical Bayesian
  analysis along with Gaussian spatial processes to estimate ancestry-specific allele
  frequencies. We demonstrate our approach using tens of thousands of control subjects
  from studies of Crohn disease, showing how it controls false positives, provides
  power similar to that achieved when all control data are directly accessible, and
  enhances power when control data are limiting or even imperfectly matched ancestrally.
  These results highlight how UNICORN can enable reliable, powerful, and convenient
  genetic association analyses without access to the individual-level data.
