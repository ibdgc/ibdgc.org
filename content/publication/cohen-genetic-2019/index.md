abstract: The intestinal microbiota is a dynamic community of bacteria, fungi, and
  viruses that mediates mucosal homeostasis and physiology. Imbalances in the microbiome
  and aberrant immune responses to gut bacteria can disrupt homeostasis and are associated
  with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) in humans and colitis in mice. We review
  genetic variants associated with IBD and their effects on the intestinal microbiome,
  the immune response, and disease pathogenesis. The intestinal microbiome, which
  includes microbial antigens, adjuvants, and metabolic products, affects the development
  and function of the intestinal mucosa, influencing inflammatory responses in the
  gut. Therefore, strategies to manipulate the microbiome might be used in treatment
  of IBD. We review microbe-based therapies for IBD and the potential to engineer
  patients' intestinal microbiota. We discuss how studies of patients with IBD and
  mouse models have advanced our understanding of the interactions between genetic
  factors and the gut microbiome, and challenges to the development of microbe-based
  therapies for IBD.
