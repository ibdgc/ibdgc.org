abstract: Crohn’s disease (CD) can affect any segment of the digestive tract but is
  most often localized in the ileal, ileocolonic, and colorectal regions of the intestines.
  It is believed that the chronic inflammation in CD is a result of an imbalance between
  the epithelial barrier, the immune system, and the intestinal microbiota. The aim
  of the study was to identify circulating markers associated with CD and/or disease
  location in CD patients.We tested 49 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in
  serum samples from 300 patients with CD and 300 controls. After quality control,
  analyte levels were tested for association with CD and disease location.We identified
  13 analytes that were higher in CD patients relative to healthy controls and that
  remained significant after conservative Bonferroni correction (P &lt; 0.0015). In
  particular, CXCL9, CXCL1, and interleukin IL-6 had the greatest effect and were
  highly significant (P &lt; 5 × 10–7). We also identified 9 analytes that were associated
  with disease location, with VEGF, IL-12p70, and IL-6 being elevated in patients
  with colorectal disease (P &lt; 3 × 10–4).Multiple serum analytes are elevated in
  CD. These implicate the involvement of multiple cell types from the immune, epithelial,
  and endothelial systems, suggesting that circulating analytes reflect the inflammatory
  processes that are ongoing within the gut. Moreover, the identification of distinct
  profiles according to disease location supports the existence of a biological difference
  between ileal and colonic CD, consistent with previous genetic and clinical observations.
