abstract: Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with elevated adaptive immunity to commensal
  microbes, with flagellin being a dominant antigen. In light of heightened awareness
  of the importance of innate immunity in regulating adaptive immunity and ambiguity
  as to the role of CD-associated immune responses in CD pathophysiology, we sought
  to determine whether natural acquisition of immune responses to flagellin were regulated
  by the innate immune flagellin receptor toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) and determine
  whether persons carrying a recently defined common dominant-negative TLR5 polymorphism
  (TLR5-stop) might be protected from developing CD. Carriage rates of a recently
  defined dominant-negative TLR5 polymorphism (TLR5-stop) and levels of serum immunoreactivity
  to bacterial products were measured in inflammatory bowel disease patients, first-degree
  relatives, and unrelated controls. We observed that, in healthy subjects, persons
  carrying TLR5-stop had significantly lower levels of flagellin-specific IgG and
  IgA but had similar levels of total and LPS-specific Ig. Moreover, we observed that,
  among Jewish subjects, the carriage rate of TLR5-stop (in heterozygous state) was
  significantly less in CD patients, but not ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, compared
  with unaffected relatives and unrelated controls (5.4, 0.9, 6.0, and 6.5% for unaffected
  relatives, CD, UC, and unrelated Jewish controls, respectively, n = 296, 215, 185,
  and 416, respectively; P = 0.037 by likelihood calculation for CD vs. controls),
  indicating that TLR5-stop can protect persons of Jewish ethnicity against CD. We
  did not observe a significant association of TLR5-stop with CD in a non-Jewish cohort
  (11.1, 10.4, and 11.7% for unaffected relatives, CD, and UC, respectively; n = 841,
  543, and 300 for unaffected relatives, respectively). These results demonstrate
  that natural acquisition of immune responses to flagellin are regulated by TLR5
  and suggest that immune responses to flagellin are not merely associated with CD
  but rather promote the pathogenic response.
