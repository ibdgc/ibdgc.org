abstract: 'The association of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) with SLE
  is well established yet the causal variants arising from this region remain to be
  identified, largely due to inadequate study design and the strong linkage disequilibrium
  demonstrated by genes across this locus. The majority of studies thus far have identified
  strong association with classical class II alleles, in particular HLA-DRB1*0301
  and HLA-DRB1*1501. Additional associations have been reported with class III alleles;
  specifically, complement C4 null alleles and a tumor necrosis factor promoter SNP
  (TNF-308G/A). However, the relative effects of these class II and class III variants
  have not been determined. We have thus used a family-based approach to map association
  signals across the MHC class II and class III regions in a cohort of 314 complete
  United Kingdom Caucasian SLE trios by typing tagging SNPs together with classical
  typing of the HLA-DRB1 locus. Using TDT and conditional regression analyses, we
  have demonstrated the presence of two distinct and independent association signals
  in SLE: HLA-DRB1*0301 (nominal p = 4.9 x 10(-8), permuted p textless 0.0001, OR
  = 2.3) and the T allele of SNP rs419788 (nominal p = 4.3 x 10(-8), permuted p textless
  0.0001, OR = 2.0) in intron 6 of the class III region gene SKIV2L. Assessment of
  genotypic risk demonstrates a likely dominant model of inheritance for HLA-DRB1*0301,
  while rs419788-T confers susceptibility in an additive manner. Furthermore, by comparing
  transmitted and untransmitted parental chromosomes, we have delimited our class
  II signal to a 180 kb region encompassing the alleles HLA-DRB1*0301-HLA-DQA1*0501-HLA-DQB1*0201
  alone. Our class III signal importantly excludes independent association at the
  TNF promoter polymorphism, TNF-308G/A, in our SLE cohort and provides a potentially
  novel locus for future genetic and functional studies.'
