abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) comprises 7 heterogeneous
  categories of chronic childhood arthritides. Approximately 5% of children with JIA
  have rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive arthritis, which phenotypically resembles adult
  rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our objective was to compare and contrast the genetics
  of RF-positive polyarticular JIA with those of RA and selected other JIA categories,
  to more fully understand the pathophysiologic relationships of inflammatory arthropathies.
  METHODS: Patients with RF-positive polyarticular JIA (n = 340) and controls (n =
  14,412) were genotyped using the Immunochip array. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms
  were tested for association using a logistic regression model adjusting for admixture
  proportions. We calculated weighted genetic risk scores (wGRS) of reported RA and
  JIA risk loci, and we compared the ability of these wGRS to predict RF-positive
  polyarticular JIA. RESULTS: As expected, the HLA region was strongly associated
  with RF-positive polyarticular JIA (P = 5.51 × 10-31 ). Nineteen of 44 RA risk loci
  and 6 of 27 oligoarticular/RF-negative polyarticular JIA risk loci were associated
  with RF-positive polyarticular JIA (P textless 0.05). The RA wGRS predicted RF-positive
  polyarticular JIA (area under the curve [AUC] 0.71) better than did the oligoarticular/RF-negative
  polyarticular JIA wGRS (AUC 0.59). The genetic profile of patients with RF-positive
  polyarticular JIA was more similar to that of RA patients with age at onset 16-29
  years than to that of RA patients with age at onset ≥70 years. CONCLUSION: RF-positive
  polyarticular JIA is genetically more similar to adult RA than to the most common
  JIA categories and thus appears to be a childhood-onset presentation of autoantibody-positive
  RA. These findings suggest common disease mechanisms, which could lead to novel
  therapeutic targets and shared treatment strategies.'
