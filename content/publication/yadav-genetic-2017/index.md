abstract: "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The role of tobacco smoke in the etiology of inflammatory\
  \ bowel disease (IBD) is unclear. We investigated interactions between genes and\
  \ smoking (gene-smoking interactions) that affect risk for Crohn's disease (CD)\
  \ and ulcerative colitis (UC) in a case-only study of patients and in mouse models\
  \ of IBD. METHODS: We used 55 Immunochip-wide datasets that included 19,735 IBD\
  \ cases (10,856 CD cases and 8879 UC cases) of known smoking status. We performed\
  \ 3 meta-analyses each for CD, UC, and IBD (CD and UC combined), comparing data\
  \ for never vs ever smokers, never vs current smokers, and never vs former smokers.\
  \ We studied the effects of exposure to cigarette smoke in Il10-/- and Nod2-/- mice,\
  \ as well as in Balb/c mice without disruption of these genes (wild-type mice).\
  \ Mice were exposed to the smoke of 5 cigarettes per day, 5 days a week, for 8 weeks,\
  \ in a ventilated smoking chamber, or ambient air (controls). Intestines were collected\
  \ and analyzed histologically and by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\
  \ RESULTS: We identified 64 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for which the\
  \ association between the SNP and IBD were modified by smoking behavior (meta-analysis\
  \ Wald test P textless 5.0 × 10-5; heterogeneity Cochrane Q test P textgreater .05).\
  \ Twenty of these variants were located within the HLA region at 6p21. Analysis\
  \ of classical HLA alleles (imputed from SNP genotypes) revealed an interaction\
  \ with smoking. We replicated the interaction of a variant in NOD2 with current\
  \ smoking in relation to the risk for CD (frameshift variant fs1007insC; rs5743293).\
  \ We identified 2 variants in the same genomic region (rs2270368 and rs17221417)\
  \ that interact with smoking in relation to CD risk. Approximately 45% of the SNPs\
  \ that interact with smoking were in close vicinity (≤1 Mb) to SNPs previously associated\
  \ with IBD; many were located near or within genes that regulate mucosal barrier\
  \ function and immune tolerance. Smoking modified the disease risk of some variants\
  \ in opposite directions for CD vs UC. Exposure of Interleukin 10 (il10)-deficient\
  \ mice to cigarette smoke accelerated development of colitis and increased expression\
  \ of interferon gamma in the small intestine compared to wild-type mice exposed\
  \ to smoke. NOD2-deficient mice exposed to cigarette smoke developed ileitis, characterized\
  \ by increased expression of interferon gamma, compared to wild-type mice exposed\
  \ to smoke. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of 55 Immunochip-wide datasets, we identified\
  \ 64 SNPs whose association with risk for IBD is modified by tobacco smoking. Gene-smoking\
  \ interactions were confirmed in mice with disruption of Il10 and Nod2-variants\
  \ of these genes have been associated with risk for IBD. Our findings from mice\
  \ and humans revealed that the effects of smoking on risk for IBD depend on genetic\
  \ variants."
