 abstract = {Background
Although anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents are effective in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), many patients either do not respond to anti-TNF
treatment or lose response over time. The aim of this study was to determine factors
associated with response to anti-TNF therapy in IBD.

Methods
Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis who had consented to
participate in a genetics registry and been treated with anti-TNF agents were evaluated
retrospectively and categorized as primary nonresponders or secondary nonresponders. We
evaluated clinical, serological, and genetic characteristics associated with primary
nonresponse or time to loss of response to anti-TNF agents.

Results
We included 314 CD (51 [16.2%] primary nonresponders and 179 [57.0%] secondary
nonresponders) and 145 subjects with ulcerative colitis (43 [29.7%] primary
nonresponders and 74 [51.0%] secondary nonresponders). Colonic involvement
(P = 0.017; odds ratio = 8.0) and anti-TNF monotherapy
(P = 0.017; odds ratio = 4.9) were associated in a multivariate
analysis with primary nonresponse to anti-TNF agents in CD. In addition, higher
anti–nuclear cytoplasmic antibody levels (P = 0.019; hazard ratio =
1.01) in CD, anti–nuclear cytoplasmic antibody positivity (P = 0.038;
hazard ratio = 1.6) in ulcerative colitis, and a positive family history of IBD
(P = 0.044; hazard ratio = 1.3) in all patients with IBD were
associated with time to loss of response to anti-TNF agents. Furthermore, various known
IBD susceptibility single-nucleotide polymorphisms and additional variants in
immune-mediated genes were shown to be associated with primary nonresponse or time to
loss of response.

Conclusions
Our results may help to optimize the use of anti-TNF agents in clinical practice and
position these therapies appropriately as clinicians strive for a more personalized
approach to managing IBD.},
