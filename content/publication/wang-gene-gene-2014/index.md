abstract: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified at least 133 ulcerative
  colitis (UC) associated loci. The role of genetic factors in clinical practice is
  not clearly defined. The relevance of genetic variants to disease pathogenesis is
  still uncertain because of not characterized gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.
  We examined the predictive value of combining the 133 UC risk loci  with genetic
  interactions in an ongoing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) GWAS. The Wellcome Trust
  Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) IBD GWAS was used as a replication cohort. We applied
  logic regression (LR), a novel adaptive regression methodology, to search for high-order
  interactions. Exploratory genotype correlations with UC sub-phenotypes [extent of
  disease, need of surgery, age of onset, extra-intestinal manifestations and primary
  sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)]  were conducted. The combination of 133 UC loci yielded
  good UC risk predictability [area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86]. A higher cumulative
  allele score predicted higher UC risk. Through LR, several lines of evidence for
  genetic interactions were identified and successfully replicated in the WTCCC cohort.
  The genetic interactions combined with the gene-smoking interaction significantly
  improved predictability in the model (AUC, from 0.86 to 0.89, P = 3.26E-05). Explained
  UC variance increased from 37 to 42 % after adding the interaction terms. A within
  case analysis found suggested genetic association with PSC. Our study demonstrates
  that the LR methodology allows the identification and replication of high-order
  genetic interactions in UC GWAS datasets. UC risk can be predicted by a 133 loci
  and improved by adding gene-gene and gene-environment  interactions.
