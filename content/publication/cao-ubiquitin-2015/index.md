abstract: CARD9 is a central component of anti-fungal innate immune signaling via
  C-type lectin receptors, and several immune-related disorders are associated with
  CARD9 alterations. Here, we used a rare CARD9 variant that confers protection against
  inflammatory bowel disease as an entry point to investigating CARD9 regulation.
  We showed that the protective variant of CARD9, which is C-terminally truncated,
  acted in a dominant-negative manner for CARD9-mediated cytokine production, indicating
  an important role for the C terminus in CARD9 signaling. We identified TRIM62 as
  a CARD9 binding partner and showed that TRIM62 facilitated K27-linked poly-ubiquitination
  of CARD9. We identified K125 as the ubiquitinated residue on CARD9 and demonstrated
  that this ubiquitination was essential for CARD9 activity. Furthermore, we showed
  that similar to Card9-deficient mice, Trim62-deficient mice had increased susceptibility
  to fungal infection. In this study, we utilized a rare protective allele to uncover
  a TRIM62-mediated mechanism for regulation of CARD9 activation.
