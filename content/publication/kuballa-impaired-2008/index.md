abstract: "The genetic risk factors predisposing individuals to the development of\
  \ inflammatory bowel disease are beginning to be deciphered by genome-wide association\
  \ studies. Surprisingly, these new data point towards a critical role of autophagy\
  \ in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. A single common coding variant in the\
  \ autophagy protein ATG16L1 predisposes individuals to the development of Crohn's\
  \ disease: while ATG16L1 encoding threonine at amino acid position 300 (ATG16L1*300T)\
  \ confers protection, ATG16L1 encoding for alanine instead of threonine (ATG16L1*300A,\
  \ also known as T300A) mediates risk towards the development of Crohn's disease.\
  \ Here we report that, in human epithelial cells, the Crohn's disease-associated\
  \ ATG16L1 coding variant shows impairment in the capture of internalized Salmonella\
  \ within autophagosomes. Thus, we propose that the association of ATG16L1*300A with\
  \ increased risk of Crohn's disease is due to impaired bacterial handling and lowered\
  \ rates of bacterial capture by autophagy."
