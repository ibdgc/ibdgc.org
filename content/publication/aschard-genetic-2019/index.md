abstract: 'Several bacteria in the gut microbiota have been shown to be associated
  with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and dozens of IBD genetic variants have been
  identified in genome-wide association studies. However, the role of the microbiota
  in the etiology of IBD in terms of host genetic susceptibility remains unclear.
  Here, we studied the association between four major genetic variants associated
  with an increased risk of IBD and bacterial taxa in up to 633 IBD cases. We performed
  systematic screening for associations, identifying and replicating associations
  between NOD2 variants and two taxa: the Roseburia genus and the Faecalibacterium
  prausnitzii species. By exploring the overall association patterns between genes
  and bacteria, we found that IBD risk alleles were significantly enriched for associations
  concordant with bacteria-IBD associations. To understand the significance of this
  pattern in terms of the study design and known effects from the literature, we used
  counterfactual principles to assess the fitness of a few parsimonious gene-bacteria-IBD
  causal models. Our analyses showed evidence that the disease risk of these genetic
  variants were likely to be partially mediated by the microbiome. We confirmed these
  results in extensive simulation studies and sensitivity analyses using the association
  between NOD2 and F. prausnitzii as a case study.'
