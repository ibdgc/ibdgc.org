abstract: Very-early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) is a heterogeneous
  phenotype associated with a spectrum of rare Mendelian disorders. Here, we perform
  whole-exome-sequencing and genome-wide genotyping in 145 patients (median age-at-diagnosis
  of 3.5 years), in whom no Mendelian disorders were clinically suspected. In five
  patients we detect a primary immunodeficiency or enteropathy, with clinical consequences
  (XIAP, CYBA, SH2D1A, PCSK1). We also present a case study of a VEO-IBD patient with
  a mosaic de novo, pathogenic allele in CYBB. The mutation is present in ~70% of
  phagocytes and sufficient to result in defective bacterial handling but not life-threatening
  infections. Finally, we show that VEO-IBD patients have, on average, higher IBD
  polygenic risk scores than population controls (99 patients and 18,780 controls;
  P textless 4 × 10-10), and replicate this finding in an independent cohort of VEO-IBD
  cases and controls (117 patients and 2,603 controls; P textless 5 × 10-10). This
  discovery indicates that a polygenic component operates in VEO-IBD pathogenesis.
