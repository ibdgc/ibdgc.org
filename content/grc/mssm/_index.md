bio: ["My major research efforts currently are: a) defining mechanisms of stromal/epithelial-immune cell cross talk in IBD; b) defining components of treatment refractory (specifically, non-response to pro-inflammatory cytokine blockade) IBD at the cellular and tissue level; c) predicting differences in clinical outcomes of interest across IBD clinical subtypes and populations; d) exploring the role of rare, IBD-associated variants of high effects; e) organizing large datasets for NIDDK IBDGC and IIBDGC; and f) developing select treatment targets based on IBD genetic and single cell expression findings. Since 2015, I have served as Director of the Personalized Medicine Institute at Mount Sinai. I am extremely excited by the explosion of data and new data tools that are accelerating collaborative efforts to benefit patients through genetic and genomic studies; I am eager to continue applying new data-approaches to benefit the NIDDK IBDGC."]

# GRC Abstract

This application from the Mount Sinai Health System proposes participation as
a genetic research center (GRC) within the NIDDK Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Genetics Consortium (IBDGC). IBD genetic discovery has disproportionately
focused on European ancestry cohorts, despite high and rising prevalence in
all US populations. In Aim 1, participation as a multi-disciplinary GRC in
Consortium-wide projects is proposed. Expanding sequence and genotype data on
non-European ancestry cohorts is proposed. New analytic methodologies have
been developed whereby more ancestrally complex populations, such as Hispanic
cohorts, can not only be meaningfully analyzed, but may confer substantial
benefits in unlocking the overall genetic architecture of polygenic diseases,
such as IBD. The application of novel clinical research tools involving
efficient electronic health record and development of more objective endpoints
can deepen longitudinal phenotype data for already recruited patients. Given
the continued centrality of anti-TNF therapies in an era of multiple new
therapies, studies to examine anti-TNF non-response (ileal resection, surgical
specimens) and response (new anti-TNF initiation, endoscopically-based) are
proposed. Specifically, in Aim 2, definition of intestinal single-cell
expression features with anti-TNF non-response and response is proposed using
mass cytometry protein analyses (Cytof), and single cell mRNA sequencing.
Single cell analyses in IBD tissues shows enormous promise in systematically
explicating the precise contributions in the most relevant context of the over
200 genome-wide significant IBD associations. Early single cell analyses point
to a highly complex innate immune cell architecture, which may be distinct
between various high effect IBD-associated risk alleles of innate immunity.
Scaling key results through correlative techniques feasible in larger cohorts,
such as using paraffin-embedded tissues and peripheral blood samples is
proposed. The advent of multiple new therapies makes this a particularly
propitious time to protocolize clinical practice, both to improve patient
care, as well as to mine biosamples for IBD research. The insight that is
gained through these studies can prioritize genes, cells and pathways from
which to scale key results and protocols across the NIDDK IBDGC. The long-term
goal of these studies is to efficiently develop protocols to most effectively
treat IBD patients, catalyzing the advent of Precision IBD.
