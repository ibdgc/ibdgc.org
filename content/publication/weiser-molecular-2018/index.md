abstract: "OBJECTIVE: The clinical presentation and course of Crohn's disease (CD)\
  \ is highly variable. We sought to better understand the cellular and molecular\
  \ mechanisms that guide this heterogeneity, and characterise the cellular processes\
  \ associated with disease phenotypes. DESIGN: We examined both gene expression and\
  \ gene regulation (chromatin accessibility) in non-inflamed colon tissue from a\
  \ cohort of adult patients with CD and control patients. To support the generality\
  \ of our findings, we analysed previously published expression data from a large\
  \ cohort of treatment-naïve paediatric CD and control ileum. RESULTS: We found that\
  \ adult patients with CD clearly segregated into two classes based on colon tissue\
  \ gene expression-one that largely resembled the normal colon and one where certain\
  \ genes showed expression patterns normally specific to the ileum. These classes\
  \ were supported by changes in gene regulatory profiles observed at the level of\
  \ chromatin accessibility, reflective of a fundamental shift in underlying molecular\
  \ phenotypes. Furthermore, gene expression from the ilea of a treatment-naïve cohort\
  \ of paediatric patients with CD could be similarly subdivided into colon-like and\
  \ ileum-like classes. Finally, expression patterns within these CD subclasses highlight\
  \ large-scale differences in the immune response and aspects of cellular metabolism,\
  \ and were associated with multiple clinical phenotypes describing disease behaviour,\
  \ including rectal disease and need for colectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly\
  \ suggest that these molecular signatures define two clinically relevant forms of\
  \ CD irrespective of tissue sampling location, patient age or treatment status."
