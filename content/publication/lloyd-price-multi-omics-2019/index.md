abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases, which include Crohn's disease and ulcerative
  colitis, affect several million individuals worldwide. Crohn's disease and ulcerative
  colitis are complex diseases that are heterogeneous at the clinical, immunological,
  molecular, genetic, and microbial levels. Individual contributing factors have been
  the focus of extensive research. As part of the Integrative Human Microbiome Project
  (HMP2 or iHMP), we followed 132 subjects for one year each to generate integrated
  longitudinal molecular profiles of host and microbial activity during disease (up
  to 24 time points each; in total 2,965 stool, biopsy, and blood specimens). Here
  we present the results, which provide a comprehensive view of functional dysbiosis
  in the gut microbiome during inflammatory bowel disease activity. We demonstrate
  a characteristic increase in facultative anaerobes at the expense of obligate anaerobes,
  as well as molecular disruptions in microbial transcription (for example, among
  clostridia), metabolite pools (acylcarnitines, bile acids, and short-chain fatty
  acids), and levels of antibodies in host serum. Periods of disease activity were
  also marked by increases in temporal variability, with characteristic taxonomic,
  functional, and biochemical shifts. Finally, integrative analysis identified microbial,
  biochemical, and host factors central to this dysregulation. The study's infrastructure
  resources, results, and data, which are available through the Inflammatory Bowel
  Disease Multi'omics Database ( http://ibdmdb.org ), provide the most comprehensive
  description to date of host and microbial activities in inflammatory bowel diseases.
