abstract: "The Puerto Rico population may be modeled as an admixed population with\
  \ contributions from three continents: Sub-Saharan Africa, Ancient America, and\
  \ Europe. Extending the study of the genetics of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)\
  \ to an admixed population such as Puerto Rico has the potential to shed light on\
  \ IBD genes identified in studies of European populations, find new genes contributing\
  \ to IBD susceptibility, and provide basic information on IBD for the care of US\
  \ patients of Puerto Rican and Latino descent. In order to study the association\
  \ between immune-related genes and Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)\
  \ in Puerto Rico, we genotyped 1159 Puerto Rican cases, controls, and family members\
  \ with the ImmunoChip. We also genotyped 832 subjects from the Human Genome Diversity\
  \ Panel to provide data for estimation of global and local continental ancestry.\
  \ Association of SNPs was tested by logistic regression corrected for global continental\
  \ descent and family structure. We observed the association between Crohn's disease\
  \ and NOD2 (rs17313265, 0.28 in CD, 0.19 in controls, OR 1.5, p = 9×10-6) and IL23R\
  \ (rs11209026, 0.026 in CD, 0.0.071 in controls, OR 0.4, p = 3.8×10-4). The haplotype\
  \ structure of both regions resembled that reported for European populations and\
  \ \\\"local\\\" continental ancestry of the IL23R gene was almost entirely of European\
  \ descent. We also observed suggestive evidence for the association of the BAZ1A\
  \ promoter SNP with CD (rs1200332, 0.45 in CD, 0.35 in controls, OR 1.5, p = 2×10-6).\
  \ Our estimate of continental ancestry surrounding this SNP suggested an origin\
  \ in Ancient America for this putative susceptibility region. Our observations underscored\
  \ the great difference between global continental ancestry and local continental\
  \ ancestry at the level of the individual gene, particularly for immune-related\
  \ loci."
