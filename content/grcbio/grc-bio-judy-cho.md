My major research efforts currently are, a) defining mechanisms of stromal/epithelial-immune cell cross talk in IBD, b) defining components of treatment refractory (specifically, non-response to pro-inflammatory cytokine blockade) IBD at the cellular and tissue level, and c) predicting differences in clinical outcomes of interest across IBD clinical subtypes and populations, d) exploring the role of rare, IBD-associated variants of high effects, e) organizing large datasets for NIDDK IBDGC and IIBDGC, and f) developing select treatment targets based on IBD genetic and single cell expression findings. Since 2015, I have served as the Director for Personalized Medicine Institute at Mount Sinai. I am extremely excited by the explosion of data and new data tools that are accelerating collaborative efforts to benefit patients through genetic and genomic studies; I am eager to continue applying new data-approaches to benefit the NIDDK IBDGC.
