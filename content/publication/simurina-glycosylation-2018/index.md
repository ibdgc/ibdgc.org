abstract: "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Causes of inflammatory bowel diseases are not well\
  \ understood and the most prominent forms, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis\
  \ (UC), are sometimes hard to distinguish. Glycosylation of IgG has been associated\
  \ with CD and UC. IgG Fc-glycosylation affects IgG effector functions. We evaluated\
  \ changes in IgG Fc-glycosylation associated with UC and CD, as well as with disease\
  \ characteristics in different patient groups. METHODS: We analyzed 3441 plasma\
  \ samples obtained from 2 independent cohorts of patients with CD (874 patients\
  \ from Italy and 391 from the United States) or UC (1056 from Italy and 253 from\
  \ the US and healthy individuals [controls]; 427 in Italy and 440 from the United\
  \ States). IgG Fc-glycosylation (tryptic glycopeptides) was analyzed by liquid chromatography\
  \ coupled to mass spectrometry. We analyzed associations between disease status\
  \ (UC vs controls, CD vs controls, and UC vs CD) and glycopeptide traits, and associations\
  \ between clinical characteristics and glycopeptide traits, using a logistic regression\
  \ model with age and sex included as covariates. RESULTS: Patients with CD or UC\
  \ had lower levels of IgG galactosylation than controls. For example, the odds ratio\
  \ (OR) for IgG1 galactosylation in patients with CD was 0.59 (95% confidence interval\
  \ [CI], 0.51-0.69) and for patients with UC was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.71-0.92). Fucosylation\
  \ of IgG was increased in patients with CD vs controls (for IgG1: OR, 1.27; 95%\
  \ CI, 1.12-1.44), but decreased in patients with UC vs controls (for IgG23: OR,\
  \ 0.72; 95% CI, 0.63-0.82). Decreased galactosylation associated with more severe\
  \ CD or UC, including the need for surgery in patients with UC vs controls (for\
  \ IgG1: OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54-0.89) and in patients with CD vs controls (for IgG23:\
  \ OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective analysis of plasma\
  \ samples from patients with CD or UC, we associated levels of IgG Fc-glycosylation\
  \ with disease (compared to controls) and its clinical features. These findings\
  \ could increase our understanding of mechanisms of CD and UC pathogenesis and be\
  \ used to develop diagnostics or guide treatment."
