abstract: "BACKGROUND: The ability to identify patients with Crohn's disease (CD)\
  \ at highest risk of surgery would be invaluable in guiding therapy. Genome-wide\
  \ association studies have identified multiple IBD loci with unknown phenotypic\
  \ consequences. The aims of this study were to: (1) identify associations between\
  \ known and novel CD loci with early resective CD surgery and (2) develop the best\
  \ predictive model for time to surgery using a combination of phenotypic, serologic,\
  \ and genetic variables. METHODS: Genotyping was performed on 1,115 subjects using\
  \ Illumina-based genome-wide technology. Univariate and multivariate analyses tested\
  \ genetic associations with need for surgery within 5 years. Analyses were performed\
  \ by testing known CD loci (n = 71) and by performing a genome-wide association\
  \ study. Time to surgery was analyzed using Cox regression modeling. Clinical and\
  \ serologic variables were included along with genotype to build predictive models\
  \ for time to surgery. RESULTS: Surgery occurred within 5 years in 239 subjects\
  \ at a median time of 12 months. Three CD susceptibility loci were independently\
  \ associated with surgery within 5 years (IL12B, IL23R, and C11orf30). Genome-wide\
  \ association identified novel putative loci associated with early surgery: 7q21\
  \ (CACNA2D1) and 9q34 (RXRA, COL5A1). The most predictive models of time to surgery\
  \ included genetic and clinical risk factors. More than a 20% difference in frequency\
  \ of progression to surgery was seen between the lowest and highest risk groups.\
  \ CONCLUSIONS: Progression to surgery is faster in patients with CD with both genetic\
  \ and clinical risk factors. IL12B is independently associated with need and time\
  \ to early surgery in CD patients and justifies the investigation of novel and existing\
  \ therapies that affect this pathway."
