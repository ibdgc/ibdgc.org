abstract: "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Microbes may increase susceptibility to inflammatory\
  \ bowel disease (IBD) by producing bioactive metabolites that affect immune activity\
  \ and epithelial function. We undertook a family based study to identify microbial\
  \ and metabolic features of IBD that may represent a predisease risk state when\
  \ found in healthy first-degree relatives. METHODS: Twenty-one families with pediatric\
  \ IBD were recruited, comprising 26 Crohn's disease patients in clinical remission,\
  \ 10 ulcerative colitis patients in clinical remission, and 54 healthy siblings/parents.\
  \ Fecal samples were collected for 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, untargeted\
  \ liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics, and calprotectin measurement.\
  \ Individuals were grouped into microbial and metabolomics states using Dirichlet\
  \ multinomial models. Multivariate models were used to identify microbes and metabolites\
  \ associated with these states. RESULTS: Individuals were classified into 2 microbial\
  \ community types. One was associated with IBD but irrespective of disease status,\
  \ had lower microbial diversity, and characteristic shifts in microbial composition\
  \ including increased Enterobacteriaceae, consistent with dysbiosis. This microbial\
  \ community type was associated similarly with IBD and reduced microbial diversity\
  \ in an independent pediatric cohort. Individuals also clustered bioinformatically\
  \ into 2 subsets with shared fecal metabolomics signatures. One metabotype was associated\
  \ with IBD and was characterized by increased bile acids, taurine, and tryptophan.\
  \ The IBD-associated microbial and metabolomics states were highly correlated, suggesting\
  \ that they represented an integrated ecosystem. Healthy relatives with the IBD-associated\
  \ microbial community type had an increased incidence of elevated fecal calprotectin.\
  \ CONCLUSIONS: Healthy first-degree relatives can have dysbiosis associated with\
  \ an altered intestinal metabolome that may signify a predisease microbial susceptibility\
  \ state or subclinical inflammation. Longitudinal prospective studies are required\
  \ to determine whether these individuals have a clinically significant increased\
  \ risk for developing IBD."
