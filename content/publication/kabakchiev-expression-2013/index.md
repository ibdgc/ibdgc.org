abstract: 'BACKGROUND & AIMS: Genome-wide association studies have greatly increased
  our understanding of intestinal disease. However, little is known about how genetic
  variations result in phenotypic changes. Some polymorphisms have been shown to modulate
  quantifiable phenotypic traits; these are called quantitative trait loci. Quantitative
  trait loci that affect levels of gene expression are called expression quantitative
  trait loci (eQTL), which can provide insight into the biological relevance of data
  from genome-wide association studies. We performed a comprehensive eQTL scan of
  intestinal tissue. METHODS: Total RNA was extracted from ileal biopsy specimens
  and genomic DNA was obtained from whole-blood samples from the same cohort of individuals.
  Cis- and trans-eQTL analyses were performed using a custom software pipeline for
  samples from 173 subjects. The analyses determined the expression levels of 19,047
  unique autosomal genes listed in the US National Center for Biotechnology Information
  database and more than 580,000 variants from the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism
  database. RESULTS: The presence of more than 15,000 cis- and trans-eQTL was detected
  with statistical significance. eQTL associated with the same expression trait were
  in high linkage disequilibrium. Comparative analysis with previous eQTL studies
  showed that 30% to 40% of genes identified as eQTL in monocytes, liver tissue, lymphoblastoid
  cell lines, T cells, and fibroblasts are also eQTL in ileal tissue. Conversely,
  most of the significant eQTL have not been previously identified and could be tissue
  specific. These are involved in many cell functions, including division and antigen
  processing and presentation. Our analysis confirmed that previously published cis-eQTL
  are single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with inflammatory bowel disease:
  rs2298428/UBE2L3, rs1050152/SLC22A4, and SLC22A5. We identified many new associations
  between inflammatory bowel disease susceptibility loci and gene expression. CONCLUSIONS:
  eQTL analysis of intestinal tissue supports findings that some eQTL remain stable
  across cell types, whereas others are specific to the sampled location. Our findings
  confirm and expand the number of known genotypes associated with expression and
  could help elucidate mechanisms of intestinal disease.'
