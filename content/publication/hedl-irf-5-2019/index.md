abstract: Common IFN regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) variants associated with multiple
  immune-mediated diseases are a major determinant of interindividual variability
  in pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-induced cytokines in macrophages. PRR-initiated
  pathways also contribute to bacterial clearance, and dysregulation of bacterial
  clearance can contribute to immune-mediated diseases. However, the role of IRF5
  in macrophage-mediated bacterial clearance is not well defined. Furthermore, it
  is unclear if macrophages from individuals who are carriers of low IRF5-expressing
  genetic variants associated with protection for immune-mediated diseases might be
  at a disadvantage in bacterial clearance. We found that IRF5 was required for optimal
  bacterial clearance in PRR-stimulated, M1-differentiated human macrophages. Mechanisms
  regulated by IRF5 included inducing reactive oxygen species through p40phox, p47phox
  and p67phox, NOS2, and autophagy through ATG5. Complementing these pathways in IRF5-deficient
  M1 macrophages restored bacterial clearance. Further, these antimicrobial pathways
  required the activation of IRF5-dependent MAPK, NF-ÎºB, and Akt2 pathways. Importantly,
  relative to high IRF5-expressing rs2004640/rs2280714 TT/TT immune-mediated disease
  risk-carrier human macrophages, M1-differentiated GG/CC carrier macrophages demonstrated
  less reactive oxygen species, NOS2, and autophagy pathway induction and, consequently,
  reduced bacterial clearance. Increasing IRF5 expression to the rs2004640/rs2280714
  TT/TT levels restored these antimicrobial pathways. We define mechanisms wherein
  common IRF5 genetic variants modulate bacterial clearance, thereby highlighting
  that immune-mediated disease risk IRF5 carriers might be relatively protected from
  microbial-associated diseases.
