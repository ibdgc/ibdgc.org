Dr. Targan bases his translational and basic research programs on an integrated science paradigm. His programs focus primarily on immunopathologic mechanisms, novel therapeutics and the translation of basic science findings for use in diagnosis, prognosis and targeted therapeutic selection in inflammatory bowel disease. Human in vitro and animal model are used in genetic and immunobiologic investigations to elucidate the dysregulated immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract that lead to mucosal inflammation.
