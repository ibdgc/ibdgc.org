We aimed to better define MHC association signals in UC and CD by combining data from dense single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and from imputation of classical  human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types, their constituent SNPs and corresponding amino acids in 562 UC, 611 CD and 1428 control subjects. Univariate and multivariate association analyses were performed, controlling for ancestry. In univariate analyses, absence of the rs9269955 C allele was strongly associated with risk for UC (P = 2.67 x 10(-13)). rs9269955 is a SNP in the codon for amino  acid position 11 of HLA-DRbeta1, located in the P6 pocket of the HLA-DR antigen binding cleft.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The complete elucidation of genetic variants that contribute to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will likely include variants that increase risk  to both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis as well as variants that increase  risk for particular phenotypic subsets. The purpose of this study was to assess phenotypic subsets that contribute to the major IBD susceptibility loci. METHODS: This linkage study encompassed 904 affected relative pairs, representing the largest combined phenotyped cohort to date, and allowing for meaningful subset analyses. Genetic linkage data were stratified by disease location and age at diagnosis. RESULTS: We establish that some loci, notably the IBD3 and chromosome  3q linkage regions demonstrate contributions from both small intestine and colon  cohorts, whereas others, notably the IBD1 (NOD2/CARD15) and IBD2 regions increase risk for small intestine or colon inflammation, respectively. The strongest linkage evidence in this study was for the subset of extensive ulcerative colitis in the region of IBD2 (lod 3.27; p {$<$} 0.001). Evidence for linkage in the region of NOD2/CARD15 (IBD1) was stronger for the subset of Crohn's patients with ileal  disease (lod 2.56; p= 0.035) compared to the overall Crohn's group, consistent with previous findings that NOD2/CARD15 variants are associated with ileal disease. CONCLUSIONS: Analyses incorporating disease location in IBD increase the power and enhance the accuracy of genomic localization. Our data provide strong evidence that extensive ulcerative colitis represents a pathophysiologic subset of IBD.},

There is considerable heterogeneity in disease course and accurate prediction of natural history has been challenging. The phenotypic implication of increasing genetic predisposition to CD or UC is unknown. METHODS: The data source for our study was a prospective cohort of CD and UC patients recruited from a tertiary referral center. All patients underwent genotyping on the Illumina Immunochip. A genetic risk score (GRS) incorporating strength of association (log odds ratio) and allele dose for each of the 163 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) risk loci was calculated and phenotypic associations examined across GRS quartiles. RESULTS: Our study cohort included 1,105 patients (697 CD, 408 UC). Increasing genetic burden was associated with earlier age of diagnosis of CD (Ptrend=0.008). Patients in the highest GRS quartile were likely to develop disease 5 years earlier than those in the lowest quartile. Increasing genetic burden was also associated with ileal involvement in CD (Ptrend {$<$}0.0001). The effect of genetic burden was independent of the NOD2 locus and was stronger among those with no NOD2 variants, and in never smokers. UC patients with an involved first-degree relative had a higher genetic burden, but GRS was not associated with disease phenotype in UC. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing genetic burden is associated with early age of diagnosis in CD, but not UC. The expanded panel of IBD risk loci explains only a fraction of variance of disease phenotype, suggesting limited clinical utility of genetics in predicting natural history.},

The exact mechanism of its effect remains unexplained. Genetic polymorphisms in metabolizing enzymes may influence susceptibility to the effect of smoking and shed light on its mechanism of action. METHODS: We used a prospective cohort of patients with CD, UC, and healthy controls. Smoking status was defined as current, former, or never smoking. Patients were genotyped for polymorphisms in CYP2A6, glutathione transferase enzymes (GSTP1 and GSTM1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO), and heme oxygenase 1 using a Sequenom platform. Multivariate logistic regression models with CD or UC as the outcome, stratified by genotype, were developed and interaction P-values calculated. RESULTS: Our study included 634 patients with CD, 401 with UC, and 337 healthy controls. Ever smokers had an increased risk of CD (odds ratio = 3.88, 95\% confidence interval = 2.35-6.39) compared with nonsmokers among patients with AG/AA genotypes at CYP2A6. However, ever smoking was not associated with CD among patients with the AA genotype (Pinteraction = 0.001). Former smoking was associated with an increased risk for UC only in the presence of GG/AG genotypes for GSTP1 but not in those with the AA genotype (Pinteraction = 0.012). Polymorphisms at the NQO and HMOX loci did not demonstrate a statistically significant interaction with smoking and risk of CD or UC. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic polymorphisms in metabolizing enzymes may influence the association between smoking and CD and UC. Further studies of gene-environment interaction in inflammatory bowel disease are warranted.},

  abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are chronic immunologically mediated diseases of the gut. Advances in genetics have revolutionized our understanding of the pathogenesis of these conditions with 163 risk loci identified, encompassing a variety of immunologic functions. There is substantial heterogeneity in the natural history of these diseases with respect to disease onset, course, and progression to complications. There are also significant variations in response to therapies and susceptibility to therapy-related and disease-related complications. An important need in the field is to identify predictors of disease course, complications, and likelihood of response and adverse events to allow for targeted therapeutic decision making. The genotype of an individual in constant and non-modifiable, and thus could potentially fulfill the role of important predictors of these outcomes. In this review, we discuss the existing literature on the prediction of various disease phenotypes in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis using underlying genotype. We also identify gaps in the literature and suggest future directions for research. There is need for large, multi-institutional, and international collaborative consortia with efficient and detailed cohort accrual, phenotypic definition, genotyping, and dynamic assessments of external (e.g., diet) and internal (microbiome) environment to allow us to progress toward personalized and precision medicine in the management of these complex diseases.},

However, the role of the microbiota in the etiology of IBD in terms of host genetic susceptibility remains unclear. Here, we studied the association between four major genetic variants associated with an increased risk of IBD and bacterial taxa in up to 633 IBD cases. We performed systematic screening for associations, identifying and replicating associations between NOD2 variants and two taxa: the Roseburia genus and the Faecalibacterium prausnitzii species. By exploring the overall association patterns between genes and bacteria, we found that IBD risk alleles were significantly enriched for associations concordant with bacteria-IBD associations. To understand the significance of this pattern in terms of the study design and known effects from the literature, we used counterfactual principles to assess the fitness of a few parsimonious gene-bacteria-IBD causal models. Our analyses showed evidence that the disease risk of these genetic variants were likely to be partially mediated by the microbiome. We confirmed these results in extensive simulation studies and sensitivity analyses using the association between NOD2 and F. prausnitzii as a case study.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Very early onset inflammatory bowel diseases (VEOIBD), including infant disorders, are a diverse group of diseases found in children younger than 6 years of age. They have been associated with several gene variants. Our aim was to identify the genes that cause VEOIBD. METHODS: We performed whole exome sequencing of DNA from 1 infant with severe enterocolitis and her parents. Candidate gene mutations were validated in 40 pediatric patients and functional studies were carried out using intestinal samples and human intestinal cell lines. RESULTS: We identified compound heterozygote mutations in the Tetratricopeptide repeat domain 7 (TTC7A) gene in an infant from non-consanguineous parents with severe exfoliative apoptotic enterocolitis; we also detected TTC7A mutations in 2 unrelated families, each with 2 affected siblings. TTC7A interacts with EFR3 homolog B to regulate phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase at the plasma membrane. Functional studies demonstrated that TTC7A is expressed in human enterocytes. The mutations we identified in TTC7A result in either mislocalization or reduced expression of TTC7A. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase was found to co-immunoprecipitate with TTC7A; the identified TTC7A mutations reduced this binding. Knockdown of TTC7A in human intestinal-like cell lines reduced their adhesion, increased apoptosis, and decreased production of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. CONCLUSIONS: In a genetic analysis, we identified loss of function mutations in TTC7A in 5 infants with VEOIBD. Functional studies demonstrated that the mutations cause defects in enterocytes and T cells that lead to severe apoptotic enterocolitis. Defects in the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase-TTC7A-EFR3 homolog B pathway are involved in the pathogenesis of VEOIBD.},

Extending the study of the genetics of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to an admixed population such as Puerto Rico has the potential to shed light on IBD genes identified in studies of European populations, find new genes contributing to IBD susceptibility, and provide basic information on IBD for the care of US patients of Puerto Rican and Latino descent. In order to study the association between immune-related genes and Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in Puerto Rico, we genotyped 1159 Puerto Rican cases, controls, and family members with the ImmunoChip. We also genotyped 832 subjects from the Human Genome Diversity Panel to provide data for estimation of global and local continental ancestry. Association of SNPs was tested by logistic regression corrected for global continental descent and family structure. We observed the association between Crohn's disease and NOD2 (rs17313265, 0.28 in CD, 0.19 in controls, OR 1.5, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}9×10-6) and IL23R (rs11209026, 0.026 in CD, 0.0.071 in controls, OR 0.4, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}3.8×10-4). The haplotype structure of both regions resembled that reported for European populations and "local" continental ancestry of the IL23R gene was almost entirely of European descent. We also observed suggestive evidence for the association of the BAZ1A promoter SNP with CD (rs1200332, 0.45 in CD, 0.35 in controls, OR 1.5, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}2×10-6). Our estimate of continental ancestry surrounding this SNP suggested an origin in Ancient America for this putative susceptibility region. Our observations underscored the great difference between global continental ancestry and local continental ancestry at the level of the individual gene, particularly for immune-related loci.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies and follow-up meta-analyses in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have recently identified 163 disease-associated loci that meet genome-wide significance for these two inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These discoveries have already had a tremendous impact on our understanding of the genetic architecture of these diseases and have directed functional studies that have revealed some of the biological functions that are important to IBD (e.g. autophagy). Nonetheless, these loci can only explain a small proportion of disease variance (\textasciitilde 14\% in CD and 7.5\% in UC), suggesting that not only are additional loci to be found but that the known loci may contain high effect rare risk variants that have gone undetected by GWAS. To test this, we have used a targeted sequencing approach in 200 UC cases and 150 healthy controls (HC), all of French Canadian descent, to study 55 genes in regions associated with UC. We performed follow-up genotyping of 42 rare non-synonymous variants in independent case-control cohorts (totaling 14,435 UC cases and 20,204 HC). Our results confirmed significant association to rare non-synonymous coding variants in both IL23R and CARD9, previously identified from sequencing of CD loci, as well as identified a novel association in RNF186. With the exception of CARD9 (OR = 0.39), the rare non-synonymous variants identified were of moderate effect (OR = 1.49 for RNF186 and OR = 0.79 for IL23R). RNF186 encodes a protein with a RING domain having predicted E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity and two transmembrane domains. Importantly, the disease-coding variant is located in the ubiquitin ligase domain. Finally, our results suggest that rare variants in genes identified by genome-wide association in UC are unlikely to contribute significantly to the overall variance for the disease. Rather, these are expected to help focus functional studies of the corresponding disease loci.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Phenotype characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may differ significantly among ethnic subpopulations. The aim of this study was to characterize the IBD phenotype in French Canadians, the most prominent founder population in North America. METHODS: Using well-characterized phenotype data in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)-IBD Genetics Consortium repository on patients with IBD, we compared phenotypic characteristics of 202 French Canadians with those of 1,287 other Caucasian patients. These included diagnosis, anatomical location, disease behavior, extraintestinal manifestations, surgical history, and family history of IBD. RESULTS: French-Canadian patients with Crohn's disease (CD) were less likely to have stricturing disease (11 vs. 21\%, P=0.005; odds ratio (OR): 0.45, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI): 0.24-0.85). Using a stringent definition of ethnicity (three out of four grandparents being French Canadians, as opposed to self-report, n=148), French Canadians had a tendency toward developing fistulizing CD (37 vs. 28\%, P=0.07), and there was an increased prevalence of sacroiliitis among those with IBD (4 vs. 2\%, P=0.045). Among French Canadians, the numbers of current smokers in CD (40 vs. 25\%, P=0.006) and former smokers in ulcerative colitis (UC) (35 vs. 20\%, P=0.03) were significantly higher. The prevalence of one of the three main variants of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among French-Canadian CD patients was 43.2\%. The 3020insC SNP correlated with small bowel disease in French Canadians (25 [corrected] vs. 0\%, P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: French Canadians show an IBD phenotype profile distinct from other Caucasian IBD populations, with an accentuated association between smoking status and IBD. This unique profile may have implications regarding the need for a different approach to the management of IBD in this population.},

  abstract = {One goal of human genetics is to understand the genetic basis of disease, a challenge for diseases of complex inheritance because risk alleles are few relative to the vast set of benign variants. Risk variants are often sought by association studies in which allele frequencies in case subjects are contrasted with those from population-based samples used as control subjects. In an ideal world we would know population-level allele frequencies, releasing researchers to focus on case subjects. We argue this ideal is possible, at least theoretically,  and we outline a path to achieving it in reality. If such a resource were to exist, it would yield ample savings and would facilitate the effective use of data repositories by removing administrative and technical barriers. We call this concept the Universal Control Repository Network (UNICORN), a means to perform association analyses without necessitating direct access to individual-level control data. Our approach to UNICORN uses existing genetic resources and various statistical tools to analyze these data, including hierarchical clustering with spectral analysis of ancestry; and empirical Bayesian analysis along with Gaussian spatial processes to estimate ancestry-specific allele frequencies. We demonstrate our approach using tens of thousands of control subjects from studies of Crohn disease, showing how it controls false positives, provides power similar to that achieved when all control data are directly accessible, and enhances power when control data are limiting or even imperfectly matched ancestrally. These results highlight how UNICORN can enable reliable, powerful, and convenient genetic association analyses without access to the individual-level data.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: In patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), symptoms do not always associate with the severity of endoscopic inflammation and can persist after mucosal healing. We investigated whether symptoms in patients with successfully treated IBD are related to the composition of the intestinal microbiome. METHODS: We analyzed 590 tissue biopsy specimens from 215 patients with IBD and 48 healthy individuals (controls). We obtained mucosal biopsy specimens from 2 colon sites (ascending and rectosigmoid) and from the terminal ileum along with clinical data. Bacterial DNA was extracted from the biopsy specimens and the V4 region of 16s ribosomal RNA sequenced by Miseq and processed using the QIIME v1.9 pipeline. RESULTS: Mucosal biopsy specimens from patients with Crohn's disease (CD) who achieved mucosal healing (Mayo scores of 0-1 or segmental endoscopic severity CD scores of 0-5) had lower Chao1 diversity than biopsy specimens from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) or unclassified IBD (IBD-U), or controls. After endoscopic evidence of improvement in patients with UC or IBD-U, diversity of the tissue-associated microbiota did not differ significantly from that of controls. Colon biopsy specimens from patients with CD had lower microbial diversity, before and after healing (segmental endoscopic severity CD scores, 0-2), than colon biopsy specimens from controls (P {$<$} .002). In patients with CD who achieved mucosal healing, residual clinical activity (CD activity index scores {$>$}150; P~= .03) and persistent diarrhea were associated with reduced microbial diversity (P~= .01). Continued diarrhea was associated with a trend toward dysbiosis, based on the microbial dysbiosis index (P~= .059). In patients with UC or IBD-U with moderate to severe inflammation, increasing severity of diarrhea was associated with reduced microbial diversity (P~= .03). CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of biopsy specimens from patients with IBD and controls, we found that despite endoscopic evidence of improvement or remission, α-diversity of the tissue-associated intestinal microbiome remained lower in patients with CD than in controls. This observation, along with the reduced Chao1 diversity and greater dysbiosis in intestinal microbiota of patients with residual symptoms of IBD, indicates that microbiome composition could be associated with persistent diarrhea.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) cause significant morbidity and are increasing in prevalence among all populations, including African Americans. More than 200 susceptibility loci have been identified in populations of predominantly European ancestry, but few loci have been associated with IBD in other ethnicities. METHODS: We performed 2 high-density, genome-wide scans comprising 2345 cases of African Americans with IBD (1646 with CD, 583 with UC, and 116 inflammatory bowel disease unclassified) and 5002 individuals without IBD (controls, identified from the Health Retirement Study and Kaiser Permanente database). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated at P~{$<~$}5.0~× 10-8 in meta-analysis with a nominal evidence (P~{$<~$}.05) in each scan were considered to have genome-wide significance. RESULTS: We detected SNPs at HLA-DRB1, and African-specific SNPs at ZNF649 and LSAMP, with associations of genome-wide significance for UC. We detected SNPs at~USP25 with associations of genome-wide significance for IBD. No associations of genome-wide significance were detected for CD. In addition, 9 genes previously associated with IBD contained SNPs with significant evidence for replication (P {$<$} 1.6~× 10-6): ADCY3, CXCR6, HLA-DRB1 to HLA-DQA1 (genome-wide significance on conditioning), IL12B,PTGER4, and TNC for IBD; IL23R, PTGER4, and SNX20 (in~strong linkage disequilibrium with NOD2) for CD; and KCNQ2 (near TNFRSF6B) for UC. Several of these genes, such as TNC (near TNFSF15), CXCR6, and genes associated with IBD at the HLA locus, contained SNPs with unique association patterns with African-specific alleles. CONCLUSIONS: We performed a genome-wide association study of African Americans with IBD and identified loci associated with UC in only this population; we also replicated IBD, CD, and UC loci identified in European populations. The detection of variants associated with IBD risk in only people of African descent demonstrates the importance of studying the genetics of IBD and other complex diseases in populations beyond those of European ancestry.},

  abstract = {Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are overlapping chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Suggestive evidence for linkage at chromosome 7q has been reported for both CD and UC. Contained within this region is the gene for MDR1 (multidrug resistance), a membrane transport protein for which human polymorphisms have been reported in Ala893Ser/Thr and C3435T that alter pharmacokinetic profiles for a variety of drugs. Because mdr1 knockout mice spontaneously develop colitis, exonic regions were resequenced and tested for IBD association in a large, multicenter North American cohort. Two missense mutations, Asn21Asp and Ala893Ser/Thr, as well as the expression-associated polymorphism C3435T, described elsewhere, were genotyped in the entire cohort. Significant association of Ala893 with IBD was observed by both case-control analysis (P=.002) and the pedigree disequilibrium test (PDT [P=.00020-.00030]) but not for the Asn21Asp or C3435T polymorphisms. Significant association by PDT was observed within the subset with CD (P=.0014-.00090), with similar, nonsignificant trends in a smaller subset with UC. The Ala893Ser/Thr variant is triallelic, and the associated, common allele is Ala893, with undertransmission of the 893Ser (common) and the 893Thr (rare) variants. The Ala893 variant has decreased activity compared with the 893Ser variant; therefore, the association with human IBD is consistent with the murine model of mdr1 deficiency. Taken together, these data support the association of the common Ala893 polymorphism with IBD specifically and, more broadly, provides additional support for its contribution to interindividual pharmacogenetic variation.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, investigators have used whole genome linkage and genome-wide association studies, including the "Immunochip" study, to identify a surprising number (over 163) of genetic loci containing susceptibility genes for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its 2 major phenotypes, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). These loci, although nearly all low-risk, have provided important lessons regarding the nature of IBD etiopathogenesis, including that most loci cause both CD and UC risk; one-third of loci have risk for other common autoimmune diseases; numerous loci contain genes that regulate immunity to microbes; Th17 cells are disproportionately influenced by genes within IBD loci; and the HLA region influences UC far greater than CD. Interleukin-10 receptor subunit (IL10RA and IL10RB) and IL10 cytokine gene mutations cause a rare, severe, infantile-onset, autosomal recessive CD, and this knowledge has allowed curative treatment by bone marrow transplant. Key tasks for broader clinical translation include discovery of risk variants for non-white populations; discovery of the less frequent but higher penetrance and familial risk variants by next-generation sequencing; and determining which of numerous associated variations within loci result in specific gene dysfunction causing IBD risk-as only a small number of genes within IBD loci, including NOD2, IL23R, ATG16L1, IRGM, and PTPN22 have specific functional variations characterized. Studying the effect of IBD susceptiblity gene dysfunctions in tissue cultures and animal models will allow the ultimate translational benefits of developing novel treatments for and potentially preventing IBD in those having specific genetic risk factors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) remains a simple, flexible, and inexpensive method for enriching genomic regions of interest for next-generation sequencing. In order to utilize PCR in this context, a major challenge facing researchers is how to generate a very large number of functional PCR primers that will successfully generate useable amplicons. For instance, in an exon-only re-sequencing project targeting 100 genes, each with 10 exons, 1,000 pairs of primers are required. In fact, the reality is often more complex as each gene might have several isoforms and large exons need to be divided to maintain the desired amplicon size. With only a list of gene names, our program Optimus Primer (OP) automatically takes into account all these variables, and can generate primers with no need to provide genome coordinates. More importantly however, OP, unlike other primer design programs, uniquely utilizes Primer3 in an iterative manner that allows the user to progressively design up to four iterations of primer designs. Through a single interface, the user can specify up to four different design parameters with different stringencies, thus increasing the probability that a functional PCR primer pair will be designed for all regions of interest in a single pass of the pipeline. FINDINGS: To demonstrate the effectiveness of the program, we designed PCR primers against 77 genes located in loci associated with ulcerative colitis as part of a candidate gene re-sequencing experiment. We achieved an experimental success rate of 93\% or 472 out of 508 amplicons spanning the exonic regions of the 77 genes. Moreover, by automatically passing amplicons that failed primer design through three additional iterations of design parameters, we achieved an additional 170 successful primer pairs or 34\% more in a single pass of OP than by conventional methods. CONCLUSION: With only a gene list and PCR parameters, a user can produce hundreds of PCR primer designs for regions of interest with a high probability of success in a very short amount of time. Optimus Primer is an essential tool for researchers who want to pursue PCR-based enrichment strategies for next-generation re-sequencing applications.

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} Using the Illumina Immunochip, candidate polymorphisms associated with clinical outcomes of PNR and DR were separately evaluated and combined into weighted genetic risk scores.

Results:\hspace{0.6em} Of 231 patients, 28 (12\%) experienced PNR and 120 (52\%) experienced DR. There was no significant difference in clinical features between primary nonresponders and responders. Eight alleles were associated with PNR. A combined clinical-genetic model (AUROC, 0.87) more accurately predicted PNR compared with a clinical-only model (AUROC, 0.57; P {$<$} 0.0001). In an external cohort of 131 patients, increasing tertiles of PNR genetic risk score correlated with increased risk of PNR (P = 0.052). Twelve candidate loci were associated with DR. Genetic risk score quartiles for DR demonstrated a strong dose-response relationship in predicting treatment duration. Genetic risk scores for PNR and DR were not associated with infliximab levels or antibody formation.

Here, we used a rare CARD9 variant that confers protection against inflammatory bowel disease as an entry point to investigating CARD9 regulation. We showed that the protective variant of CARD9, which is C-terminally truncated, acted in a dominant-negative manner for CARD9-mediated cytokine production, indicating an important role for the C terminus in CARD9 signaling. We identified TRIM62 as a CARD9 binding partner and showed that TRIM62 facilitated K27-linked poly-ubiquitination of CARD9. We identified K125 as the ubiquitinated residue on CARD9 and demonstrated that this ubiquitination was essential for CARD9 activity. Furthermore, we showed that similar to Card9-deficient mice, Trim62-deficient mice had increased susceptibility to fungal infection. In this study, we utilized a rare protective allele to uncover a TRIM62-mediated mechanism for regulation of CARD9 activation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Recent literature has implicated a key role for mast cells in murine models of colonic inflammation, but their role in human ulcerative colitis (UC) is not well-established. A major advance has been the identification of mrgprb2 (human orthologue, MRGPX2) as mediating IgE-independent mast cell activation. We sought to define mechanisms of mast cell activation and MRGPRX2 in human UC. METHODS: Colon tissues were collected from UC patients for bulk RNAseq and lamina propria cells were isolated for MRGPRX2 activation studies and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). Genetic association of all protein altering GPCR SNPs was performed in an Ashkenazi Jewish UC case-control cohort. Variants of MRGPRX2 were transfected into CHO and HMC-1.1 cells to detect genotype-dependent effects on β-arrestin recruitment, IP-1 accumulation, and phosphoERK. RESULTS: Mast cell-specific mediators and ADM (adrenomedullin, proteolytic precursor of PAMP-12, an MRGPRX2 agonist) are upregulated in inflamed compared to uninflamed UC. MRGPRX2 stimulation induces carboxypeptidase secretion from inflamed UC. Of all protein-altering GPCR alleles, a unique variant of MRGPRX2, Asn62Ser, was most associated, bioinformatically predicted to alter arrestin recruitment. We validated that the UC protective serine allele enhances beta-arrestin recruitment, decreases IP-1, and increases phosphoERK with MRGPRX2 agonists. scRNASeq defines that ADM is expressed by activated fibroblasts and epithelial cells, and that IFNG is a key, upstream regulator of mast cell gene expression. CONCLUSION: Inflamed UC regions are distinguished by MRGPRX2-mediated activation of mast cells, with decreased activation observed with a UC-protective genetic variant. These results define cell modules of UC activation and a new therapeutic target.},

  abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are complex, multifactorial disorders that comprise Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Genome-wide association studies have identified approximately 100 loci that are significantly associated with IBD. These loci implicate a diverse array of genes and pathophysiologic mechanisms, including microbe recognition, lymphocyte activation, cytokine signaling, and intestinal epithelial defense. Consistent with epidemiologic predictions, many IBD-associated loci demonstrate genome-wide significant associations to both CD and UC, notably, genes whose products function in the interleukin-23 pathway, and transcription factors, including NK2 transcription factor related, locus 3 (NKX2-3), SMAD3, STAT3, ZMIZ1, and c-REL. Although CD and UC are both associated with genomic regions that implicate products of genes involved in leukocyte trafficking, there is evidence for association patterns that are distinct between CD and UC. CD-predominant associations include NOD2 and genes that regulate autophagy. In UC, the predominant association signal is on chromosome 6p21, in the major histocompatibility complex region, near HLA class II genes. UC-predominant loci have also implicated genes mediating epithelial defense function. There is a striking overlap of loci between diseases, which could provide comparative insight into mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. Genes that encode factors that function in the interleukin-23 pathway have been associated with a number of chronic inflammatory diseases, notably psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. Distinct genetic associations indicate that the colitis associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis is pathophysiologically distinct from UC that is not associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis. As many as 14 susceptibility loci are shared between IBD and celiac disease, indicating significant overlap in pathophysiology. Future genetic studies will be directed toward identifying uncommon variations with potentially greater statistical effects, defining population differences, and more completely accounting for familial transmission of disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) has the highest prevalence in Ashkenazi Jewish populations. We sought to identify rare, CD-associated frameshift variants of high functional and statistical effects. METHODS: We performed exome sequencing and array-based genotype analyses of 1477 Ashkenazi Jewish individuals with CD and 2614 Ashkenazi Jewish individuals without CD (controls). To validate our findings, we performed genotype analyses of an additional 1515 CD cases and 7052 controls for frameshift mutations in the colony-stimulating factor 2-receptor β common subunit gene (CSF2RB). Intestinal tissues and blood samples were collected from patients with CD; lamina propria leukocytes were isolated and expression of CSF2RB and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-responsive cells were defined by adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF analysis). Variants of CSF2RB were transfected into HEK293 cells and the expression and functions of gene products were compared. RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, we~associated CD with a frameshift mutation in CSF2RB (P~=~8.52~× 10(-4)); the finding was validated in the replication cohort (combined P~= 3.42~× 10(-6)). Incubation of intestinal lamina propria leukocytes with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor resulted in high levels of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT5) and lesser increases in phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and AK straining transforming (AKT). Cells co-transfected with~full-length and mutant forms of CSF2RB had reduced pSTAT5 after stimulation with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, compared with cells transfected with control CSF2RB, indicating a dominant-negative effect of the mutant gene. Monocytes from patients with CD who were heterozygous for the frameshift mutation (6\% of CD cases analyzed) had~reduced responses to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and markedly decreased activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase; activity of this enzyme has been associated with immune tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: In a genetic analysis of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, we associated CD with a frameshift mutation in CSF2RB. Intestinal monocytes from carriers of this mutation had reduced responses to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, providing an additional mechanism for alterations to the innate immune response in individuals with CD.},

Repetitive injury induces increased mortality, impaired recovery of intestinal barrier function, failure to contain bacteria within the intestine and impaired autophagy. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) administration protected against injury by enhancing epithelial barrier function and limiting systemic infection. Effects of IBD therapeutic agents were defined: mesalamine showed protective features during injury, whereas 6-mercaptopurine displayed marked induction of autophagy during recovery.

The human commensal Bacteroides fragilis delivers immunomodulatory molecules to immune cells via secretion of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). We reveal that OMVs require IBD-associated genes, ATG16L1 and NOD2, to activate a noncanonical autophagy pathway during protection from colitis. ATG16L1-deficient dendritic cells do not induce regulatory T cells (T(regs)) to suppress mucosal inflammation. Immune cells from human subjects with a major risk variant in ATG16L1 are defective in T(reg) responses to OMVs. We propose that polymorphisms in susceptibility genes promote disease through defects in "sensing" protective signals from the microbiome, defining a potentially critical gene-environment etiology for IBD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Biomarkers are needed for early detection of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) or to predict patient outcomes. Glycosylation is a common and complex posttranslational modification of proteins that affects their structure and activity. We compared plasma N-glycosylation~profiles between patients with CD or UC and healthy individuals (controls). METHODS: We analyzed the total plasma N-glycomes of 2635 patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and 996 controls by mass spectrometry with a linkage-specific sialic acid derivatization technique. Plasma samples were acquired from 2 hospitals in Italy (discovery cohort, 1989 patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] and 570 controls) and 1 medical center in the United States (validation cohort, 646 cases of IBD and 426 controls). Sixty-three glycoforms met our criteria for relative quantification and were extracted from the raw data with the software MassyTools. Common features shared by the glycan compositions were combined in 78 derived traits, including the number of antennae of complex-type glycans and levels of fucosylation, bisection, galactosylation, and sialylation. Associations of plasma N-glycomes~with age, sex, CD, UC, and IBD-related parameters such as disease location, surgery and medication, level of C-reactive protein, and sedimentation rate were tested by linear and logistic regression. RESULTS: Plasma samples from patients with IBD had a higher abundance of large-size glycans compared with controls, a decreased relative abundance of hybrid and high-mannose structures, lower fucosylation, lower galactosylation, and higher sialylation (α2,3- and α2,6-linked). We could discriminate plasma from patients with CD from that of patients with UC based on higher bisection, lower galactosylation, and higher sialylation (α2,3-linked). Glycosylation patterns were associated with disease location and progression, the need for a more potent medication, and surgery. These results were replicated in a large independent cohort. CONCLUSIONS: We performed high-throughput analysis to compare total plasma N-glycomes of individuals with vs without IBD and to identify patterns associated with disease features and the need for treatment. These profiles might be used in diagnosis and for predicting patients' responses to treatment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease; treatment strategies have historically been determined by this binary categorisation. Genetic studies have identified 163 susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel disease, mostly shared between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. We undertook the largest genotype association study, to date, in widely used clinical subphenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease with the goal of further understanding the biological relations between diseases. METHODS: This study included patients from 49 centres in 16 countries in Europe, North America, and Australasia. We applied the Montreal classification system of inflammatory bowel disease subphenotypes to 34,819 patients (19,713 with Crohn's disease, 14,683 with ulcerative colitis) genotyped on the Immunochip array. We tested for genotype-phenotype associations across 156,154 genetic variants. We generated genetic risk scores by combining information from all known inflammatory bowel disease associations to summarise the total load of genetic risk for a particular phenotype. We used these risk scores to test the hypothesis that colonic Crohn's disease, ileal Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis are all genetically distinct from each other, and to attempt to identify patients with a mismatch between clinical diagnosis and genetic risk profile. FINDINGS: After quality control, the primary analysis included 29,838 patients (16,902 with Crohn's disease, 12,597 with ulcerative colitis). Three loci (NOD2, MHC, and MST1 3p21) were associated with subphenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease, mainly disease location (essentially fixed over time; median follow-up of 10·5 years). Little or no genetic association with disease behaviour (which changed dramatically over time) remained after conditioning on disease location and age at onset. The genetic risk score representing all known risk alleles for inflammatory bowel disease showed strong association with disease subphenotype (p=1·65\hphantom{,}×\hphantom{,}10(-78)), even after exclusion of NOD2, MHC, and 3p21 (p=9·23\hphantom{,}×\hphantom{,}10(-18)). Predictive models based on the genetic risk score strongly distinguished colonic from ileal Crohn's disease. Our genetic risk score could also identify a small number of patients with discrepant genetic risk profiles who were significantly more likely to have a revised diagnosis after follow-up (p=6·8\hphantom{,}×\hphantom{,}10(-4)). INTERPRETATION: Our data support a continuum of disorders within inflammatory bowel disease, much better explained by three groups (ileal Crohn's disease, colonic Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis) than by Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis as currently defined. Disease location is an intrinsic aspect of a patient's disease, in part genetically determined, and the major driver to changes in disease behaviour over time.

Imbalances in the microbiome and aberrant immune responses to gut bacteria can disrupt homeostasis and are associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) in humans and colitis in mice. We review genetic variants associated with IBD and their effects on the intestinal microbiome, the immune response, and disease pathogenesis. The intestinal microbiome, which includes microbial antigens, adjuvants, and metabolic products, affects the development and function of the intestinal mucosa, influencing inflammatory responses in the gut. Therefore, strategies to manipulate the microbiome might be used in treatment of IBD. We review microbe-based therapies for IBD and the potential to engineer patients' intestinal microbiota. We discuss how studies of patients with IBD and mouse models have advanced our understanding of the interactions between genetic factors and the gut microbiome, and challenges to the development of microbe-based therapies for IBD.},

  abstract = {Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem complex autoimmune disease of uncertain etiology (OMIM 152700). Over recent years a genetic component to SLE susceptibility has been established. Recent successes with association studies in SLE have identified genes including IRF5 (refs. 4,5) and FCGR3B. Two tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily members located within intervals showing genetic linkage with SLE are TNFSF4 (also known as OX40L; 1q25), which is expressed on activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and vascular endothelial cells, and also its unique receptor, TNFRSF4 (also known as OX40; 1p36), which is primarily expressed on activated CD4+ T cells. TNFSF4 produces a potent co-stimulatory signal for activated CD4+ T cells after engagement of TNFRSF4 (ref. 11). Using both a family-based and a case-control study design, we show that the upstream region of TNFSF4 contains a single risk haplotype for SLE, which is correlated with increased expression of both cell-surface TNFSF4 and the TNFSF4 transcript. We hypothesize that increased expression of TNFSF4 predisposes to SLE either by quantitatively augmenting T cell-APC interaction or by influencing the functional consequences of T cell activation via TNFRSF4.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) collects DNA and phenotypic data from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) subjects to provide a resource for genetic studies. No previous studies have been performed on the reliability and validity of phenotypic determinations in either Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) using primary records. Our aim was to determine the reliability and validity of these phenotypic assessments. METHODS: The de-identified records of 30 IBD patients were reviewed by 2 phenotypers per center using a standard protocol for phenotypic assessment. Each phenotyper evaluated 10 charts on 2 occasions 5 months apart. Reliability was expressed as the kappa (kappa) statistic. Performance characteristics were determined by comparison to a consensus-derived "gold standard" and by generation of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Agreement for diagnosis was excellent (kappa = 0.82; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71-0.92). Agreement for  CD location was good for jejunal, ileal, colorectal, and perianal disease with kappa between 0.60 and 0.74 but was fair for esophagogastroduodenal (kappa = 0.36). Agreement for UC extent (kappa = 0.67; 95\% CI: 0.48-0.85), and CD behavior (kappa = 0.67; 95\% CI: 0.49-0.83) were very good. Area under the ROC curves was greater than 0.84 for diagnosis, CD behavior, UC extent, and ileal and colonic CD location. CONCLUSIONS: IBD phenotype classification using a standard protocol exhibited very good to excellent inter- and intrarater agreement and validity. This study highlights the importance of standard protocols in generating reliable and valid phenotypic assessments. The data will facilitate estimates of phenotyping misclassification rates that should be considered when making inferences from IBD genotype-phenotype studies.},

METHODS: AAs with CD and controls were recruited by the Mid-Atlantic African-American IBD Study as part of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) IBD Genetics Consortium. Genotyping for the three common CD NOD2 mutations (Leu1007fsinsC, G908R/2722g{$>$}c, and R702W/2104c{$>$}t) and ASCA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed in 183 AA CD patients and in 143 controls. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the association between ASCA and disease phenotype. RESULTS: ASCA sensitivity and specificity values were 70.5 and 70.4\%, respectively. On univariate analysis, ASCA was significantly associated with younger age at diagnosis, ileal involvement, and complicated (stricturing/penetrating) behavior. On multivariate analysis, ASCA titer (per 25 Units) was associated with ileal involvement (OR 1.18, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-1.34), complicated behavior (OR 1.13, 95\% CI: 1.01-1.28), and surgery (hazard ratio: 1.11, 95\% CI: 1.02-1.21). Cigarette smoking and CD family history were also significantly associated with surgery. NOD2 carriers (all heterozygotes) were more common among CD cases than controls (8.2 vs. 2.1\%; OR 4.17\%, 95\% CI: 1.18-14.69). The NOD2 mutation population attributable risk was 6.2\%. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with whites, ASCA in AAs has a similar sensitivity but a lower specificity for CD. ASCA is associated with ileal involvement, complicated behavior, and surgery in AAs with CD. NOD2 is a risk gene for AA CD, although mutation frequency and population attributable risk are much lower than in whites.},

In the research setting, imputation helps avoid costs for wet lab-based HLA typing and thus renders association analyses of the HLA in large cohorts feasible. Yet, most HLA imputation reference panels target Caucasian ethnicities and multi-ethnic panels are scarce. We compiled a high-quality multi-ethnic reference panel based on genotypes measured with Illumina's Immunochip genotyping array and HLA types established using a high-resolution next generation sequencing approach. Our reference panel includes more than 1,300 samples from Germany, Malta, China, India, Iran, Japan and Korea and samples of African American ancestry for all classical HLA class I and II alleles including HLA-DRB3/4/5. Applying extensive cross-validation, we benchmarked the imputation using the HLA imputation tool HIBAG, our multi-ethnic reference and an independent, previously published data set compiled of subpopulations of the 1000 Genomes project. We achieved average imputation accuracies higher than 0.924 for the commonly studied HLA-A, -B, -C, -DQB1 and -DRB1 genes across all ethnicities. We investigated allele-specific imputation challenges in regard to geographic origin of the samples using sensitivity and specificity measurements as well as allele frequencies and identified HLA alleles that are challenging to impute for each of the populations separately. In conclusion, our new multi-ethnic reference data set allows for high resolution HLA imputation of genotypes at all classical HLA class I and II genes including the HLA-DRB3/4/5 loci based on diverse ancestry populations.},

Genetic association studies have identified the highly variable human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region as the strongest susceptibility locus for IBD, and specifically DRB1*01:03 as a determining factor for ulcerative colitis (UC). However, for most of the association signal such a delineation could not be made due to tight structures of linkage disequilibrium within the HLA. The aim of this study was therefore to further characterize the HLA signal using a trans-ethnic approach. We performed a comprehensive fine mapping of single HLA alleles in UC in a cohort of 9272 individuals with African American, East Asian, Puerto Rican, Indian and Iranian descent and 40\,691 previously analyzed Caucasians, additionally analyzing whole HLA haplotypes. We computationally characterized the binding of associated HLA alleles to human self-peptides and analysed the physico-chemical properties of the HLA proteins and predicted self-peptidomes. Highlighting alleles of the HLA-DRB1*15 group and their correlated HLA-DQ-DR haplotypes, we identified consistent associations (regarding effects directions/magnitudes) across different ethnicities but also identified population-specific signals (regarding differences in allele frequencies). We observed that DRB1*01:03 is mostly present in individuals of Western European descent and hardly present in non-Caucasian individuals. We found peptides predicted to bind to risk HLA alleles to be rich in positively charged amino acids such. We conclude that the HLA plays an important role for UC susceptibility across different ethnicities. This research further implicates specific features of peptides that are predicted to bind risk and protective HLA proteins.},

  abstract = {The intestinal flora has long been thought to play a role either in initiating or in exacerbating the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Host defenses, such as those mediated by the Toll-like receptors (TLR), are critical to the host/pathogen interaction and have been implicated in IBD pathophysiology. To explore the association of genetic variation in TLR pathways with susceptibility  to IBD, we performed a replication study and pooled analyses of the putative IBD  risk alleles in NFKB1 and TLR4, and we performed a haplotype-based screen for association to IBD in the TLR genes and a selection of their adaptor and signaling molecules. Our genotyping of 1539 cases of IBD and pooled analysis of 4805 cases of IBD validates the published association of a TLR4 allele with risk  of IBD (odds ratio (OR): 1.30, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.15-1.48; P=0.00017) and Crohn's disease (OR: 1.33, 95\% CI: 1.16-1.54; P=0.000035) but not  ulcerative colitis. We also describe novel suggestive evidence that TIRAP (OR: 1.16, 95\% CI: 1.04-1.30; P=0.007) has a modest effect on risk of IBD. Our analysis, therefore, offers additional evidence that the TLR4 pathway - in this case, TLR4 and its signaling molecule TIRAP - plays a role in susceptibility to IBD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The molecular aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] and its two subtypes, ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD], have been carefully investigated at genome and transcriptome levels. Recent advances in high-throughput proteome quantification has enabled comprehensive large-scale plasma proteomics studies of IBD. METHODS: The study used two cohorts: [1] The CERTIFI-cohort: 42 samples from the CERTIFI trial of anti-TNFα-refractory CD patients; [2] the PROgECT-UNITI-HCs cohort: 46 UC samples of the PROgECT study, 84 CD samples of the UNITI I and UNITI II studies, and 72 healthy controls recruited in Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, USA. The plasma proteome for these two cohorts was quantified using high-throughput platforms. RESULTS: For the PROgECT-UNITI-HCs cohort, we measured a total of 1310 proteins. Of these, 493 proteins showed different plasma levels in IBD patients to the plasma levels in controls at 10\% false discovery rate [FDR], among which 11 proteins had a fold change greater than 2. The proteins upregulated in IBD were associated with immunity functionality, whereas the proteins downregulated in IBD were associated with nutrition and metabolism. The proteomic profiles were very similar between UC and CD. In the CERTIFI cohort, 1014 proteins were measured, and it was found that the plasma protein level had little correlation with the blood or intestine transcriptomes. CONCLUSIONS: We report the largest proteomics study to date on IBD and controls. A large proportion of plasma proteins are altered in IBD, which provides insights into the disease aetiology and indicates a potential for biomarker discovery.},

Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have increased our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to IBD. The aim was to test associations of known IBD susceptibility loci and novel "pharmacogenetic" GWAS identified loci with primary nonresponse to anti-TNFalpha in pediatric IBD patients and develop a predictive model of primary nonresponse. METHODS: Primary nonresponse was defined using the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) for Crohn's disease (CD) and partial Mayo score for ulcerative colitis (UC). Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Infinium platform. Chi-square analysis tested associations of phenotype and genotype with primary nonresponse. Genetic associations were identified by testing known IBD susceptibility loci and by performing a GWAS for primary nonresponse. Stepwise multiple logistic regression was performed to build predictive models. RESULTS: Nonresponse occurred in 22 of 94 subjects. Six known susceptibility loci were associated with primary nonresponse (P {$<$} 0.05). Only the 21q22.2/BRWDI loci remained significant in the predictive model. The most predictive model included 3 novel "pharmacogenetic" GWAS loci, the previously identified BRWD1, pANCA, and a UC diagnosis (R(2) = 0.82 and area under the curve [AUC] = 0.98\%). The relative risk of nonresponse increased 15-fold when number of risk factors increased from 0-2 to {$>$} or =3. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of phenotype and genotype is most predictive of primary nonresponse to anti-TNFalpha in pediatric IBD. Defining predictors of response to anti-TNFalpha may allow the identification of patients who will not benefit from this class of therapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ability to identify patients with Crohn's disease (CD) at highest risk of surgery would be invaluable in guiding therapy. Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple IBD loci with unknown phenotypic consequences. The aims of this study were to: (1) identify associations between known and novel CD loci with early resective CD surgery and (2) develop the best predictive model for time to surgery using a combination of phenotypic, serologic, and genetic variables. METHODS: Genotyping was performed on 1,115 subjects using Illumina-based genome-wide technology. Univariate and multivariate analyses tested genetic associations with need for surgery within 5 years. Analyses were performed by testing known CD loci (n = 71) and by performing a genome-wide association study. Time to surgery was analyzed using Cox regression modeling. Clinical and serologic variables were included along with genotype to build predictive models for time to surgery. RESULTS: Surgery occurred within 5 years in 239 subjects at a median time of 12 months. Three CD susceptibility loci were independently associated with surgery within 5 years (IL12B, IL23R, and C11orf30). Genome-wide association identified novel putative loci associated with early surgery: 7q21 (CACNA2D1) and 9q34 (RXRA, COL5A1). The most predictive models of time to surgery included genetic and clinical risk factors. More than a 20\% difference in frequency of progression to surgery was seen between the lowest and highest risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: Progression to surgery is faster in patients with CD with both genetic and clinical risk factors. IL12B is independently associated with need and time to early surgery in CD patients and justifies the investigation of novel and existing therapies that affect this pathway.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 140 Crohn's disease (CD) susceptibility loci. For most loci, the variants that cause  disease are not known and the genes affected by these variants have not been identified. We aimed to identify variants that cause CD through detailed sequencing, genetic association, expression, and functional studies. METHODS: We  sequenced whole exomes of 42 unrelated subjects with CD and 5 healthy subjects (controls) and then filtered single nucleotide variants by incorporating association results from meta-analyses of CD GWAS and in silico mutation effect prediction algorithms. We then genotyped 9348 subjects with CD, 2868 subjects with ulcerative colitis, and 14,567 control subjects and associated variants analyzed in functional studies using materials from subjects and controls and in  vitro model systems. RESULTS: We identified rare missense mutations in PR domain-containing 1 (PRDM1) and associated these with CD. These mutations increased proliferation of T cells and secretion of cytokines on activation and increased expression of the adhesion molecule L-selectin. A common CD risk allele, identified in GWAS, correlated with reduced expression of PRDM1 in ileal  biopsy specimens and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (combined P = 1.6 x 10(-8)). We identified an association between CD and a common missense variant, Val248Ala, in nuclear domain 10 protein 52 (NDP52) (P = 4.83 x 10(-9)). We found  that this variant impairs the regulatory functions of NDP52 to inhibit nuclear factor kappaB activation of genes that regulate inflammation and affect the stability of proteins in Toll-like receptor pathways. CONCLUSIONS: We have extended the results of GWAS and provide evidence that variants in PRDM1 and NDP52 determine susceptibility to CD. PRDM1 maps adjacent to a CD interval identified in GWAS and encodes a transcription factor expressed by T and B cells. NDP52 is an adaptor protein that functions in selective autophagy of intracellular bacteria and signaling molecules, supporting the role of autophagy  in the pathogenesis of CD.},

In light of the dramatic success of Crohn's disease (CD) gene discovery efforts, we aimed to characterize the contribution of established common risk variants to pediatric CD. METHODS: Using 35 confirmed CD  risk alleles, we genotyped 384 parent-child trios (mean age of onset 11.7 years)  along with 321 healthy controls. We performed association tests on the independent pediatric cohort and compared results to those previously published.1 We also computed a weighted CD genetic risk score for each affected person. Six variants not previously validated in children (at 5q33, 1q24, 7p12, 12q12, 8q24,  and 1q32) were significantly associated with pediatric CD (P {$<$} 0.03). RESULTS: We detected no significant association between risk score and age at onset through age 30. This analysis illustrates that the genetic effect of established CD risk  variants is similar in early and later onset CD. CONCLUSIONS: These results motivate joint analyses of genome-wide association data in early and late onset cohorts and suggest that, rather than established risk variants, independent variants or environmental exposures should be sought as modulators of age of onset.},

We have performed a review and pooled analysis of the past 30 years of research on the role of the MHC in six genetically complex disease traits - multiple sclerosis (MS), type 1 diabetes (T1D), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) - in order to consolidate and evaluate the current literature regarding MHC genetics in these common autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. We corroborate established MHC disease associations and identify predisposing variants that previously have not been appreciated. Furthermore, we find a number of interesting commonalities and differences across diseases that implicate both general and disease-specific pathogenetic mechanisms in autoimmunity.},

  abstract = {The association of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) with SLE is well established yet the causal variants arising from this region remain to be identified, largely due to inadequate study design and the strong linkage disequilibrium demonstrated by genes across this locus. The majority of studies thus far have identified strong association with classical class II alleles, in particular HLA-DRB1*0301 and HLA-DRB1*1501. Additional associations have been reported with class III alleles; specifically, complement C4 null alleles and a tumor necrosis factor promoter SNP (TNF-308G/A). However, the relative effects of these class II and class III variants have not been determined. We have thus used a family-based approach to map association signals across the MHC class II and class III regions in a cohort of 314 complete United Kingdom Caucasian SLE trios by typing tagging SNPs together with classical typing of the HLA-DRB1 locus. Using TDT and conditional regression analyses, we have demonstrated the presence of two distinct and independent association signals in SLE: HLA-DRB1*0301 (nominal p = 4.9 x 10(-8), permuted p {$<$} 0.0001, OR = 2.3) and the T allele of SNP rs419788 (nominal p = 4.3 x 10(-8), permuted p {$<$} 0.0001, OR = 2.0) in intron 6 of the class III region gene SKIV2L. Assessment of genotypic risk demonstrates a likely dominant model of inheritance for HLA-DRB1*0301, while rs419788-T confers susceptibility in an additive manner. Furthermore, by comparing transmitted and untransmitted parental chromosomes, we have delimited our class II signal to a 180 kb region encompassing the alleles HLA-DRB1*0301-HLA-DQA1*0501-HLA-DQB1*0201 alone. Our class III signal importantly excludes independent association at the TNF promoter polymorphism, TNF-308G/A, in our SLE cohort and provides a potentially novel locus for future genetic and functional studies.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Genetic susceptibility is known to play a large part in the predisposition to the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) known as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The IL2/IL21 locus on 4q27 is known to be a common risk locus for inflammatory disease (shown in coeliac disease, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and psoriasis), while the roles that interleukin 2 (IL2) and IL21 play in the immune response also make them attractive candidates for IBD. The objective of this study was to test for association between the IL2/IL21 locus and the IBDs. METHODS: The four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL2/IL21 locus most associated with coeliac disease were genotyped in 1590 subjects with IBD and 929 controls from The Netherlands, and then replicated in a North American cohort (2387 cases and 1266 controls) and an Italian cohort (805 cases and 421 controls), yielding a total of 4782 cases (3194 UC, 1588 CD) and 2616 controls. Allelic association testing and a pooled analysis using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test were performed. RESULTS: All four SNPs were strongly associated with UC in all three cohorts and reached genome-wide significance in the pooled analysis (rs13151961 p = 1.35 x 10(-10), rs13119723 p = 8.60 x 10(-8), rs6840978 p = 3.0 7x 10(-8), rs6822844 p = 2.77 x 10(-9)). A moderate association with CD was also found in the pooled analysis (p value range 0.0016-9.86 x 10(-5)). CONCLUSIONS: A strong association for the IL2/IL21 locus with UC was found, which also confirms it as a general susceptibility locus for inflammatory disease.},

  abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and celiac disease (CelD) are chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases, involving genetic and environmental factors in their pathogenesis. The two diseases can co-occur within families, and studies suggest that CelD patients have a higher risk to develop CD than the general population. These observations suggest that CD and CelD may share common genetic risk loci. Two such shared loci, IL18RAP and PTPN2, have already been identified independently in these two diseases. The aim of our study was to explicitly identify shared risk loci for these diseases by combining results from genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets of CD and CelD. Specifically, GWAS results from CelD (768 cases, 1,422 controls) and CD (3,230 cases, 4,829 controls) were combined in a meta-analysis. Nine independent regions had nominal association p-value {$<$}1.0 x 10⁻⁵ in this meta-analysis and showed evidence of association to the individual diseases in the original scans (p-value {$<$} 1 x 10⁻² in CelD and {$<$} 1 x 10⁻³ in CD). These include the two previously reported shared loci, IL18RAP and PTPN2, with p-values of 3.37 x 10⁻⁸ and 6.39 x 10⁻⁹, respectively, in the meta-analysis. The other seven had not been reported as shared loci and thus were tested in additional CelD (3,149 cases and 4,714 controls) and CD (1,835 cases and 1,669 controls) cohorts. Two of these loci, TAGAP and PUS10, showed significant evidence of replication (Bonferroni corrected p-values {$<$}0.0071) in the combined CelD and CD replication cohorts and were firmly established as shared risk loci of genome-wide significance, with overall combined p-values of 1.55 x 10⁻¹⁰ and 1.38 x 10⁻¹¹ respectively.

  abstract = {The goal of this work was to develop a label-free, comprehensive, and reproducible high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based untargeted lipidomic workflow using a single instrument, which could be applied to biomarker discovery in both basic and clinical studies. For this, we have (i) optimized lipid extraction and elution to enhance coverage of polar and nonpolar lipids as well as resolution of their isomers, (ii) ensured MS signal reproducibility and linearity, and (iii) developed a bioinformatic pipeline to correct remaining biases. Workflow validation is reported for 48 replicates of a single human plasma sample: 1124 reproducible LC-MS signals were extracted (median signal intensity RSD = 10\%), 50\% of which are redundant due to adducts, dimers, in-source fragmentation, contaminations, or positive and negative ion duplicates. From the resulting 578 unique compounds, 428 lipids were identified by MS/MS, including acyl chain composition, of which 394 had RSD {$<$} 30\% inside their linear intensity range, thereby enabling robust semiquantitation. MS signal intensity spanned 4 orders of magnitude, covering 16 lipid subclasses. Finally, the power of our workflow is illustrated by a proof-of-concept study in which 100 samples from healthy human subjects were analyzed and the data set was investigated using three different statistical testing strategies in order to compare their capacity in identifying the impact of sex and age on circulating lipids.},

We leveraged exome-sequence and SNP array data from 29,358 individuals in the multi-ethnic, randomly-ascertained health system-based BioMe biobank to define effects of common and rare IBD variants on disease prediction and pathophysiology. METHODS: PRS were calculated from European, African-American, and Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) reference case-control studies, and a meta-GWAS run using all three association datasets. PRS were then combined using regression to assess which combination of scores best predicted IBD status in European, AJ, Hispanic, and African American cohorts in BioMe. Additionally, rare variants were assessed in genes associated with very early onset IBD (VEO-IBD), by estimating genetic penetrance in each BioMe population. RESULTS: Combining risk scores based on association data from distinct ancestral populations improved IBD prediction for every population in BioMe and significantly improved prediction among European ancestry UK Biobank individuals. Lower predictive power for non-Europeans was observed, reflecting in part substantially lower African IBD case-control reference sizes. We replicated associations for two VEO-IBD genes, ADAM17 and LRBA, with high dominant model penetrance in BioMe. Autosomal recessive LRBA risk alleles are associated with severe, early-onset autoimmunity; we show that heterozygous carriage of an African-predominant LRBA protein-altering allele is associated with significantly decreased LRBA and CTLA-4 expression with T cell activation. CONCLUSIONS: Greater genetic diversity in African populations improves prediction across populations, and generalizes some VEO-IBD genes. Increasing African-American IBD case-collections should be prioritized to reduce health disparities and enhance pathophysiologic insight.},

The primary aim of this study was to define which CD locus genes are most likely to be disease related. We developed a gene prioritization regression model (GPRM) by integrating complementary mRNA expression datasets, including bulk RNA-Seq from the terminal ileum of 302 newly diagnosed, untreated CD patients and controls, and in stimulated monocytes. Transcriptome-wide association and co-expression network analyses were performed on the ileal RNA-Seq datasets, identifying 40 genome-wide significant genes. Co-expression network analysis identified a single gene module, which was substantially enriched for CD locus genes and most highly expressed in monocytes. By including expression-based and epigenetic information, we refined likely CD genes to 2.5 prioritized genes per locus from an average of 7.8 total genes. We validated our model structure using cross-validation and our prioritization results by protein-association network analyses, which demonstrated significantly higher CD gene interactions for prioritized compared with non-prioritized genes. Although individual datasets cannot convey all of the information relevant to a disease, combining data from multiple relevant expression-based datasets improves prediction of disease genes and helps to further understanding of disease pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with elevated adaptive immunity to commensal microbes, with flagellin being a dominant antigen. In light of heightened awareness of the importance of innate immunity in regulating adaptive immunity and ambiguity as to the role of CD-associated immune responses in CD pathophysiology, we sought to determine whether natural acquisition of immune responses to flagellin were regulated by the innate immune flagellin receptor toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) and determine whether persons carrying a recently defined common dominant-negative TLR5 polymorphism (TLR5-stop) might be protected from developing CD. Carriage rates of a recently defined dominant-negative TLR5 polymorphism (TLR5-stop) and levels of serum immunoreactivity to bacterial products were measured in inflammatory bowel disease patients, first-degree relatives, and unrelated controls. We observed that, in healthy subjects, persons carrying TLR5-stop had significantly lower levels of flagellin-specific IgG and IgA but had similar levels of total and LPS-specific Ig. Moreover, we observed that, among Jewish subjects, the carriage rate of TLR5-stop (in heterozygous state) was significantly less in CD patients, but not ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, compared with unaffected relatives and unrelated controls (5.4, 0.9, 6.0, and 6.5\% for unaffected relatives, CD, UC, and unrelated Jewish controls, respectively, n = 296, 215, 185, and 416, respectively; P = 0.037 by likelihood calculation for CD vs. controls), indicating that TLR5-stop can protect persons of Jewish ethnicity against CD. We did not observe a significant association of TLR5-stop with CD in a non-Jewish cohort (11.1, 10.4, and 11.7\% for unaffected relatives, CD, and UC, respectively; n = 841, 543, and 300 for unaffected relatives, respectively). These results demonstrate that natural acquisition of immune responses to flagellin are regulated by TLR5 and suggest that immune responses to flagellin are not merely associated with CD but rather promote the pathogenic response.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Variants in the tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 15 gene (TNFSF15, also called TL1A) have been associated with risk for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). TL1A affects expression of multiple cytokines to promote mucosal inflammation. Little is known about the TL1A-response pathways that regulate cytokine expression. We investigated T-cell gene expression patterns to determine the mechanisms by which TL1A regulates cytokine production, and whether these associate with outcomes of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Peripheral T cells isolated from normal donors were cultured with TL1A. We performed gene expression profile analysis by RNA sequencing of subsets of interferon gamma (IFNG)-producing and non-producing cells purified by flow cytometry. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis was used to identify gene expression differences between these subsets. Ribonuclease T2 gene (RNASET2) expression and methylation were assessed by quantitative trait loci analyses. Clinical characteristics of patients (complications, resistance to therapy, and recurrence time) were associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms in RNASET2. We performed motif screening to identify polymorphisms that disrupt transcription factor binding sites. Levels of RNASET2 were knocked down with small interfering RNA in CD4+ T cells and the effect on protein expression was determined by proteomic analysis and cytokine production. Cell aggregation was measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: We identified 764 genes with at least a 2-fold difference in TL1A-mediated expression between IFNG-secreting and non-secreting T cells (P {$<$} 1~× 10-5). Many of these genes were located near IBD susceptibility variants. RNASET2 was the only IBD risk-associated gene with {$>$}5-fold down-regulation in the IFNG-secreting subset. RNASET2 disease risk variants were associated with decreased expression in peripheral and mucosal tissues and DNA hypermethylation in CD patients requiring surgical intervention. RNASET2 disease risk variants were associated in CD patients with more complicated disease or resistance to therapy, defined in part by failed response to treatment, increased length of intestinal resection, shorter time to repeat surgery, and high Rutgeerts score ({$>$}2) in postoperative endoscopy. The RNASET2 variant rs2149092 was predicted to disrupt a consensus binding site for the transcription factor ETS within an enhancer region. Expression of RNASET2 correlated with expression of ETS. RNASET2 knockdown in T cells increased expression of IFNG and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) and induced T-cell aggregation. A blocking antibody against (ILFA1), disrupting the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1-intercellular adhesion molecule 1 interaction, reduced T-cell production of IFNG. CONCLUSIONS: We identified decreased expression of RNASET2 as a component of TL1A-mediated increase in production of IFNG and as a potential biomarker for patients with severe CD. Further study of the role of RNASET2 in regulating mucosal inflammation may lead to development of novel therapeutic targets.},

We have thus been pursuing a region on chromosome 3p21-22 showing linkage to CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) using a gene-centric association mapping approach. We identified 12 functional candidate genes by searching for literature cocitations with relevant keywords and for gene expression patterns consistent with immune/intestinal function. We then performed an association study composed of a screening phase, where tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were evaluated in 1,020 IBD patients, and an independent replication phase in 745 IBD patients. These analyses identified and replicated significant association with IBD for four SNPs within a 1.2 Mb linkage disequilibrium region. We then identified a non-synonymous coding variant (rs3197999, R689C) in the macrophage-stimulating 1 (MST1) gene (P-value 3.62 x 10(-6)) that accounts for the association signal, and shows association with both CD and UC. MST1 encodes macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP), a protein regulating the innate immune responses to bacterial ligands. R689C is predicted to interfere with MSP binding to its receptor, suggesting a role for this gene in the pathogenesis of IBD.},

  abstract = {The phagocyte oxidative burst, mediated by Nox2 NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species, confers host defense against a broad spectrum of bacterial and fungal pathogens. Loss-of-function mutations that impair function of the Nox2 complex result in a life-threatening immunodeficiency, and genetic variants of Nox2 subunits have been implicated in pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Thus, alterations in the oxidative burst can profoundly impact host defense, yet little is known about regulatory mechanisms that fine-tune this response. Here we report the discovery of regulatory nodes controlling oxidative burst by functional screening of genes within loci linked to human inflammatory disease. Implementing a multi-omics approach, we define transcriptional, metabolic and ubiquitin-cycling nodes controlled by Rbpj, Pfkl and Rnf145, respectively. Furthermore, we implicate Rnf145 in proteostasis of the Nox2 complex by endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. Consequently, ablation of Rnf145 in murine macrophages enhances bacterial clearance, and rescues the oxidative burst defects associated with Ncf4 haploinsufficiency.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: TGFβ is a multifunctional cytokine that is critical in regulating mucosal immunity. Murine studies have revealed that disruption of canonical TGFβ signaling leads to systemic inflammation including colitis. Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) results from heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding the subunits of the TGFβ receptor. METHODS: All patients with confirmed mutations in TGFBR1 or TGFBR2, seen in the Johns Hopkins Connective Tissue Disorders clinic, were asked to participate in the study. Ninety-three consecutive patients were enrolled, including 4 with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Using the Illumina Immunochip array, we undertook an exploratory analysis to evaluate the potential genetic risk factors that could predict which patients with LDS would develop IBD. RESULTS: We report an increased prevalence of IBD in patients with LDS types I and II. We describe the course of several patients. In this small sample, the 3 whites with IBD had a genetic risk score in the top 6 highest scores of patients evaluated. CONCLUSION: We report a 10-fold increase in the prevalence of IBD in patients with LDS compared with the general population. Onset of disease in 3 of the 4 patients was at less than 18 years, and the clinical course in 2 of the 4 was severe with a poor response to traditional medications. Further evaluation of the genetic risk score is needed to determine whether it can predict which patients with LDS are most likely to develop IBD. This case series of patients with LDS with IBD suggests that defective TGFβ signaling may have an influence on IBD risk.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple Crohn's disease (CD) susceptibility loci, including association with non-coding intergenic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 10q21. DESIGN: To fine-map the 10q21 locus, the authors genotyped 86 SNPs in 1632 CD cases and 961 controls and performed single-marker and conditional analyses using logistic regression. RESULTS: Association with CD risk spanning 11 SNPs (p{$<$}0.001) was observed. The most significant association observed was at the non-synonymous SNP, rs7076156 (Ala62Thr), in ZNF365. The alanine allele was over-represented in CD (p=5.23×10⁻⁷; OR=1.39 (95\% CI 1.22 to 1.58)); allele frequency of 76\% in CD and 69.7\% in controls). Conditional analysis on rs7076156 nullified all other significant associations, suggesting that this is the causative variant at this locus. Four isoforms of ZNF365 have previously been identified, and rs7076156 is located in an exon unique to ZNF365 isoform D. The authors demonstrated, using reverse transcription-PCR, expression of ZNF365D in intestinal resections from both CD subjects and controls. Markedly reduced mean expression levels of ZNF365D were identified in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from CD subjects homozygous for the risk allele (Ala). A whole-genome microarray expression study further suggested that the Ala62Thr change in ZNF365 isoform D is related to differential expression of the genes ARL4A, MKKS, RRAGD, SUMF2, TDR1 and ZNF148 in CD. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that the non-synonymous Ala62Thr SNP, rs7076156, underlies the association between 10q21 and CD risk and suggest that this SNP acts by altering expression of genes under the control of ZNF365 isoform D.},

In the current study, we explore whether microbial translocation in CD serves as a central cue for CrF development. We discovered a subset of mucosal-associated gut bacteria that consistently translocated and remained viable in CrF in CD ileal surgical resections, and identified Clostridium innocuum as a signature of this consortium with strain variation between mucosal and adipose isolates, suggesting preference for lipid-rich environments. Single-cell RNA sequencing characterized CrF as both pro-fibrotic and pro-adipogenic with a rich milieu of activated immune cells responding to microbial stimuli, which we confirm in gnotobiotic mice colonized with C. innocuum. Ex vivo validation of expression patterns suggests C. innocuum stimulates tissue remodeling via M2 macrophages, leading to an adipose tissue barrier that serves to prevent systemic dissemination of bacteria.},

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases in the mucosal barrier maintain gut homeostasis and defend against pathogenic attack. We hypothesized that molecular genetic defects in intestinal NADPH oxidases might be present in children with IBD. METHODS: After targeted exome sequencing of epithelial NADPH oxidases NOX1 and DUOX2 on 209 children with very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEOIBD), the identified mutations were validated using Sanger Sequencing. A structural analysis of NOX1 and DUOX2 variants was performed by homology in silico modeling. The functional characterization included ROS generation in model cell lines and in in vivo transduced murine crypts, protein expression, intracellular localization, and cell-based infection studies with the enteric pathogens Campylobacter jejuni and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. RESULTS: We identified missense mutations in NOX1 (c.988G{$>$}A, p.Pro330Ser; c.967G{$>$}A, p.Asp360Asn) and DUOX2 (c.4474G{$>$}A, p.Arg1211Cys; c.3631C{$>$}T, p.Arg1492Cys) in 5 of 209 VEOIBD patients. The NOX1 p.Asp360Asn variant was replicated in a male Ashkenazi Jewish ulcerative colitis cohort. All NOX1 and DUOX2 variants showed reduced ROS production compared with wild-type enzymes. Despite appropriate cellular localization and comparable pathogen-stimulated translocation of altered oxidases, cells harboring NOX1 or DUOX2 variants had defective host resistance to infection with C. jejuni. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies the first inactivating missense variants in NOX1 and DUOX2 associated with VEOIBD. Defective ROS production from intestinal epithelial cells constitutes a risk factor for developing VEOIBD.},

  abstract = {Common IFN regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) variants associated with multiple immune-mediated diseases are a major determinant of interindividual variability in pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-induced cytokines in macrophages. PRR-initiated pathways also contribute to bacterial clearance, and dysregulation of bacterial clearance can contribute to immune-mediated diseases. However, the role of IRF5 in macrophage-mediated bacterial clearance is not well defined. Furthermore, it is unclear if macrophages from individuals who are carriers of low IRF5-expressing genetic variants associated with protection for immune-mediated diseases might be at a disadvantage in bacterial clearance. We found that IRF5 was required for optimal bacterial clearance in PRR-stimulated, M1-differentiated human macrophages. Mechanisms regulated by IRF5 included inducing reactive oxygen species through p40phox, p47phox and p67phox, NOS2, and autophagy through ATG5. Complementing these pathways in IRF5-deficient M1 macrophages restored bacterial clearance. Further, these antimicrobial pathways required the activation of IRF5-dependent MAPK, NF-κB, and Akt2 pathways. Importantly, relative to high IRF5-expressing rs2004640/rs2280714 TT/TT immune-mediated disease risk-carrier human macrophages, M1-differentiated GG/CC carrier macrophages demonstrated less reactive oxygen species, NOS2, and autophagy pathway induction and, consequently, reduced bacterial clearance. Increasing IRF5 expression to the rs2004640/rs2280714 TT/TT levels restored these antimicrobial pathways. We define mechanisms wherein common IRF5 genetic variants modulate bacterial clearance, thereby highlighting that immune-mediated disease risk IRF5 carriers might be relatively protected from microbial-associated diseases.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) comprises 7 heterogeneous categories of chronic childhood arthritides. Approximately 5\% of children with JIA have rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive arthritis, which phenotypically resembles adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our objective was to compare and contrast the genetics of RF-positive polyarticular JIA with those of RA and selected other JIA categories, to more fully understand the pathophysiologic relationships of inflammatory arthropathies. METHODS: Patients with RF-positive polyarticular JIA (n = 340) and controls (n = 14,412) were genotyped using the Immunochip array. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms were tested for association using a logistic regression model adjusting for admixture proportions. We calculated weighted genetic risk scores (wGRS) of reported RA and JIA risk loci, and we compared the ability of these wGRS to predict RF-positive polyarticular JIA. RESULTS: As expected, the HLA region was strongly associated with RF-positive polyarticular JIA (P = 5.51 × 10-31 ). Nineteen of 44 RA risk loci and 6 of 27 oligoarticular/RF-negative polyarticular JIA risk loci were associated with RF-positive polyarticular JIA (P {$<$} 0.05). The RA wGRS predicted RF-positive polyarticular JIA (area under the curve [AUC] 0.71) better than did the oligoarticular/RF-negative polyarticular JIA wGRS (AUC 0.59). The genetic profile of patients with RF-positive polyarticular JIA was more similar to that of RA patients with age at onset 16-29 years than to that of RA patients with age at onset ≥70 years. CONCLUSION: RF-positive polyarticular JIA is genetically more similar to adult RA than to the most common JIA categories and thus appears to be a childhood-onset presentation of autoantibody-positive RA. These findings suggest common disease mechanisms, which could lead to novel therapeutic targets and shared treatment strategies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Obesity is a global epidemic which increases the risk of the metabolic syndrome. Cathelicidin (LL-37 and mCRAMP) is an antimicrobial peptide with an unknown role in obesity. We hypothesize that cathelicidin expression correlates with obesity and modulates fat mass and hepatic steatosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male C57BL/6\,J mice were fed a high-fat diet. Streptozotocin was injected into mice to induce diabetes. Experimental groups were injected with cathelicidin and CD36 overexpressing lentiviruses. Human mesenteric fat adipocytes, mouse 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes and human HepG2 hepatocytes were used in the in vitro experiments. Cathelicidin levels in non-diabetic, prediabetic and type II diabetic patients were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Lentiviral cathelicidin overexpression reduced hepatic steatosis and decreased the fat mass of high-fat diet-treated diabetic mice. Cathelicidin overexpression reduced mesenteric fat and hepatic fatty acid translocase (CD36) expression that was reversed by lentiviral CD36 overexpression. Exposure of adipocytes and hepatocytes to cathelicidin significantly inhibited CD36 expression and reduced lipid accumulation. Serum cathelicidin protein levels were significantly increased in non-diabetic and prediabetic patients with obesity, compared with non-diabetic patients with normal body mass index (BMI) values. Prediabetic patients had lower serum cathelicidin protein levels than non-diabetic subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Cathelicidin inhibits the CD36 fat receptor and lipid accumulation in adipocytes and hepatocytes, leading to a reduction of fat mass and hepatic steatosis in vivo. Circulating cathelicidin levels are associated with increased BMI. Our results demonstrate that cathelicidin modulates the development of obesity.},

Analyses of the interactions between KIR3DL1, KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2, and KIR2DL3 with their respective HLA ligands indicate that there is a protective effect for KIR2DL2 in the absence of its HLA ligand C1. Given that KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 segregate as alleles, we compared their genotypic distributions to expectations under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) with regard to the HLA ligand C1 status. While all the genotypic distributions conform to expectations under HWE in controls, in C2 ligand homozygous cases there is significant deviation from HWE, with a reduction of KIR2DL2, KIR2DL3 heterozygotes. KIR2DL2, KIR2DL3 heterozygosity is the only genotypic combination that confers protection from CD. In addition to the protective effect (OR = 0.44, CI = 0.22-0.87; p = 0.018) observed in C2 ligand homozygotes, the KIR2DL2, KIR2DL3 genotype is predisposing (OR = 1.34, CI = 1.03-4.53; p = 0.031) in the presence of C1 ligand. A test for trend of HLA class I C ligand group genotypes with KIR2DL2, KIR2DL3 heterozygosity in cases and controls indicates that C1, C2 ligand group heterozygotes have an intermediate effect on predisposition. These results show for the first time that disease susceptibility may be related to heterozygosity at a specific KIR locus, and that HLA ligand genotype influences the relative effect of the KIR genotype.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has familial aggregation in African Americans (AAs), but little is known about the molecular genetic susceptibility. Mapping studies using the Immunochip genotyping array expand the number of susceptibility loci for IBD in Caucasians to 163, but the contribution of the 163 loci and European admixture to IBD risk in AAs is unclear. We performed a genetic mapping study using the Immunochip to determine whether IBD susceptibility loci in Caucasians also affect risk in AAs and identify new associated loci. METHODS: We recruited AAs with IBD and without IBD (controls) from 34 IBD centers in the United States; additional controls were collected from 4 other Immunochip studies. Association and admixture loci were mapped for 1088 patients with Crohn's disease, 361 with ulcerative colitis, 62 with IBD type unknown, and 1797 controls; 130,241 autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed. RESULTS: The strongest associations were observed between ulcerative colitis and HLA rs9271366 (P~= 7.5 × 10(-6)), Crohn's disease and 5p13.1 rs4286721 (P~= 3.5 × 10(-6)), and IBD and KAT2A rs730086 (P~= 2.3 × 10(-6)). Additional suggestive associations (P {$<$} 4.2 × 10(-5)) were observed between Crohn's disease and IBD and African-specific SNPs in STAT5A and STAT3; between IBD and SNPs in IL23R, IL12B, and C2orf43; and between ulcerative colitis and SNPs near HDAC11 and near LINC00994. The latter 3 loci have not been previously associated with IBD, but require replication. Established Caucasian associations were replicated in AAs (P {$<$} 3.1 × 10(-4)) at NOD2, IL23R, 5p15.3, and IKZF3. Significant admixture (P {$<$} 3.9 × 10(-4)) was observed for 17q12-17q21.31 (IZKF3 through STAT3), 10q11.23-10q21.2, 15q22.2-15q23, and 16p12.2-16p12.1. Network analyses showed significant enrichment (false discovery rate {$<$}1 × 10(-5)) in genes that encode members of the JAK-STAT, cytokine, and chemokine signaling pathways, as well those involved in pathogenesis of measles. CONCLUSIONS: In a genetic analysis of 3308 AA IBD cases and controls, we found that many variants associated with IBD in Caucasians also showed association evidence with these diseases in AAs; we also found evidence for variants and loci not previously associated with IBD. The complex genetic factors that determine risk for or protection against IBD in different populations require further study.},

  abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders that affect millions of people worldwide. Genome-wide association studies have identified 200 inflammatory bowel disease-associated loci, but few have been conclusively resolved to specific functional variants. Here we report fine-mapping of 94 inflammatory bowel disease loci using high-density genotyping in 67,852 individuals. We pinpoint 18 associations to a single causal variant with greater than 95\% certainty, and an additional 27 associations to a single variant with greater than 50\% certainty. These 45 variants are significantly enriched for protein-coding changes (n\,=\,13), direct disruption of transcription-factor binding sites (n\,=\,3), and tissue-specific epigenetic marks (n\,=\,10), with the last category showing enrichment in specific immune cells among associations stronger in Crohn's disease and in gut mucosa among associations stronger in ulcerative colitis. The results of this study suggest that high-resolution fine-mapping in large samples can convert many discoveries from genome-wide association studies into statistically convincing causal variants, providing a powerful substrate for experimental elucidation of disease mechanisms.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Approximately, one-third to one-half of children with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) develop gastrointestinal inflammation characteristic of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), usually Crohn's disease. We hypothesized that the overall IBD genetic risk, determined by IBD genetic risk score (GRS), might in part determine IBD development in CGD. METHODS: We reviewed medical records to establish IBD diagnoses in CGD subjects seen at NIAID. IBD risk single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes were determined using the Immunochip, and GRS were estimated by Mangrove. RESULTS: Among 157 white patients with CGD, 55 were confirmed, 78 excluded, and 24 were uncertain for IBD. Two hundred one established, independent European IBD risk single nucleotide polymorphisms passed quality control. After sample quality control and removing non-IBD CGD patients with perianal disease, mean GRS for 40 unrelated patients with CGD-IBD was higher than 53 CGD non-IBD patients (in log2-scale 0.08 ± 1.62 versus -0.67 ± 1.64, P = 0.026) but lower than 239 IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) young-onset Crohn's disease cases (0.76 ± 1.60, P = 0.025). GRS for non-IBD CGD was similar to 609 IBDGC controls (-0.69 ± 1.60, P = 0.95). Seven established IBD single nucleotide polymorphisms were nominally significant among CGD-IBD versus CGD non-IBD, including those near LACC1 (P = 0.005), CXCL14 (P = 0.007), and TNFSF15 (P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: The weight of the common IBD risk alleles are significant determinants of IBD in CGD. However, IBD risk gene burden among CGD children with IBD is significantly lower than that in nonsyndromic pediatric Crohn's disease, congruent with the concept that defective superoxide production in CGD is also a major IBD risk factor. Individual IBD genes might interact with the CGD defect to cause IBD in CGD.},

  abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD), a form of inflammatory bowel disease, has a higher prevalence in Ashkenazi Jewish than in non-Jewish European populations. To define the role of nonsynonymous mutations, we performed exome sequencing of Ashkenazi Jewish patients with CD, followed by array-based genotyping and association analysis in 2066 CD cases and 3633 healthy controls. We detected association signals in the LRRK2 gene that conferred risk for CD (N2081D variant, P = 9.5 × 10-10) or protection from CD (N551K variant, tagging R1398H-associated haplotype, P = 3.3 × 10-8). These variants affected CD age of onset, disease location, LRRK2 activity, and autophagy. Bayesian network analysis of CD patient intestinal tissue further implicated LRRK2 in CD pathogenesis. Analysis of the extended LRRK2 locus in 24,570 CD cases, patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and healthy controls revealed extensive pleiotropy, with shared genetic effects between CD and PD in both Ashkenazi Jewish and non-Jewish cohorts. The LRRK2 N2081D CD risk allele is located in the same kinase domain as G2019S, a mutation that is the major genetic cause of familial and sporadic PD. Like the G2019S mutation, the N2081D variant was associated with increased kinase activity, whereas neither N551K nor R1398H variants on the protective haplotype altered kinase activity. We also confirmed that R1398H, but not N551K, increased guanosine triphosphate binding and hydrolyzing enzyme (GTPase) activity, thereby deactivating LRRK2. The presence of shared LRRK2 alleles in CD and PD provides refined insight into disease mechanisms and may have major implications for the treatment of these two seemingly unrelated diseases.},

Furthermore, most studies to date have been limited to the examination of a subset of the HLA and non-HLA genes with a marker density and sample size insufficient for mapping all independent association signals. We genotyped a panel of 1,472 SNPs to capture the common genomic variation across the 3.44 megabase (Mb) classic MHC region in 10,576 DNA samples derived from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, selective IgA deficiency, multiple sclerosis, and appropriate control samples. We identified the primary association signals for each disease and performed conditional regression to identify independent secondary signals.

We undertook a family based study to identify microbial and metabolic features of IBD that may represent a predisease risk state when found in healthy first-degree relatives. METHODS: Twenty-one families with pediatric IBD were recruited, comprising 26 Crohn's disease patients in clinical remission, 10 ulcerative colitis patients in clinical remission, and 54 healthy siblings/parents. Fecal samples were collected for 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics, and calprotectin measurement. Individuals were grouped into microbial and metabolomics states using Dirichlet multinomial models. Multivariate models were used to identify microbes and metabolites associated with these states. RESULTS: Individuals were classified into 2 microbial community types. One was associated with IBD but irrespective of disease status, had lower microbial diversity, and characteristic shifts in microbial composition including increased Enterobacteriaceae, consistent with dysbiosis. This microbial community type was associated similarly with IBD and reduced microbial diversity in an independent pediatric cohort. Individuals also clustered bioinformatically into 2 subsets with shared fecal metabolomics signatures. One metabotype was associated with IBD and was characterized by increased bile acids, taurine, and tryptophan. The IBD-associated microbial and metabolomics states were highly correlated, suggesting that they represented an integrated ecosystem. Healthy relatives with the IBD-associated microbial community type had an increased incidence of elevated fecal calprotectin. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy first-degree relatives can have dysbiosis associated with an altered intestinal metabolome that may signify a predisease microbial susceptibility state or subclinical inflammation. Longitudinal prospective studies are required to determine whether these individuals have a clinically significant increased risk for developing IBD.},

Genome-wide association studies and subsequent meta-analyses of these two diseases as separate phenotypes have implicated previously unsuspected mechanisms, such as autophagy, in their pathogenesis and showed that some IBD loci are shared with other inflammatory diseases. Here we expand on the knowledge of relevant pathways by undertaking a meta-analysis of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis genome-wide association scans, followed by extensive validation of significant findings, with a combined total of more than 75,000 cases and controls. We identify 71 new associations, for a total of 163 IBD loci, that meet genome-wide significance thresholds. Most loci contribute to both phenotypes, and both directional (consistently favouring one allele over the course of human history) and balancing (favouring the retention of both alleles within populations) selection effects are evident. Many IBD loci are also implicated in other immune-mediated disorders, most notably with ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis. We also observe considerable overlap between susceptibility loci for IBD and mycobacterial infection. Gene co-expression network analysis emphasizes this relationship, with pathways shared between host responses to mycobacteria and those predisposing to IBD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Genome-wide association studies have greatly increased our understanding of intestinal disease. However, little is known about how genetic variations result in phenotypic changes. Some polymorphisms have been shown to modulate quantifiable phenotypic traits; these are called quantitative trait loci. Quantitative trait loci that affect levels of gene expression are called expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), which can provide insight into the biological relevance of data from genome-wide association studies. We performed a comprehensive eQTL scan of intestinal tissue. METHODS: Total RNA was extracted from ileal biopsy specimens and genomic DNA was obtained from whole-blood samples from the same cohort of individuals. Cis- and trans-eQTL analyses were performed using a custom software pipeline for samples from 173 subjects. The analyses determined the expression levels of 19,047 unique autosomal genes listed in the US National Center for Biotechnology Information database and more than 580,000 variants from the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database. RESULTS: The presence of more than 15,000 cis- and trans-eQTL was detected with statistical significance. eQTL associated with the same expression trait were in high linkage disequilibrium. Comparative analysis with previous eQTL studies showed that 30\% to 40\% of genes identified as eQTL in monocytes, liver tissue, lymphoblastoid cell lines, T cells, and fibroblasts are also eQTL in ileal tissue. Conversely, most of the significant eQTL have not been previously identified and could be tissue specific. These are involved in many cell functions, including division and antigen processing and presentation. Our analysis confirmed that previously published cis-eQTL are single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with inflammatory bowel disease: rs2298428/UBE2L3, rs1050152/SLC22A4, and SLC22A5. We identified many new associations between inflammatory bowel disease susceptibility loci and gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: eQTL analysis of intestinal tissue supports findings that some eQTL remain stable across cell types, whereas others are specific to the sampled location. Our findings confirm and expand the number of known genotypes associated with expression and could help elucidate mechanisms of intestinal disease.},

Previous studies investigating the etiology of pCD have been limited in the numbers of subjects and the intensity of genotyping. The aim of this study was to identify clinical, serological, and genetic factors associated with pCD. METHODS: We performed a case-control study comparing patients with (pCD+) and without perianal (pCD) involvement in CD; defined as the presence of perianal abscesses or fistulae. Data on demographics and clinical features were obtained by chart review. Inflammatory bowel disease-related serology was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genetic data were generated using Illumina genotyping platforms. RESULTS: We included 1721 patients with CD of which 524 (30.4\%) were pCD+ and 1197 were pPCD. pCD was associated with distal colonic disease (Odds ratio 5.54 [3.23-9.52], P {$<$} 0.001), stricturing disease behavior (1.44 [1.14-1.81], P = 0.002) and family history of inflammatory bowel disease (4.98 [3.30-7.46], P {$<$} 0.001). pCD was associated with higher anti-sacharomyces cerevisae antibodies IgA (P {$<$} 0.001) and OmpC (P = 0.008) antibody levels. pCD was associated with known inflammatory bowel disease loci, including KIF3B, CRTC3, TRAF3IP2, JAZF1, NRIP1, MST1, FUT2, and PTGER (all P {$<$} 0.05). We also identified genetic association with genes involved in autophagy (DAPK1, P = 5.11 × 10), TNF alpha pathways (NUCB2, P = 8.68 × 10; DAPK1), IFNg pathways (DAPK1; NDFIP2, P = 8.74 × 10), and extracellular matrix and scaffolding proteins (USH1C, P = 8.68 × 10; NDFIP2; TMC07, P = 8.87 × 10). Pathway analyses implicated the JAK-Stat pathway (pc = 3.72 × 10). CONCLUSION: We have identified associations between pCD, more distal colonic inflammation, Crohn's disease-associated serologies, and genetic variation in the JAK-Stat pathway.},

  abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is a complex disorder resulting from the interaction of intestinal microbiota with the host immune system in genetically susceptible individuals. The largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association to date identified 71 CD-susceptibility loci in individuals of European ancestry. An important epidemiological feature of CD is that it is 2-4 times more prevalent among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) descent compared to non-Jewish Europeans (NJ). To explore genetic variation associated with CD in AJs, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) by combining raw genotype data across 10 AJ cohorts consisting of 907 cases and 2,345 controls in the discovery stage, followed up by a replication study in 971 cases and 2,124 controls. We confirmed genome-wide significant associations of 9 known CD loci in AJs and replicated 3 additional loci with strong signal (p{$<$}5×10⁻⁶). Novel signals detected among AJs were mapped to chromosomes 5q21.1 (rs7705924, combined p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}2×10⁻⁸; combined odds ratio OR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.48), 2p15 (rs6545946, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}7×10⁻⁹; OR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.16), 8q21.11 (rs12677663, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}2×10⁻⁸; OR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.15), 10q26.3 (rs10734105, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}3×10⁻⁸; OR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.27), and 11q12.1 (rs11229030, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}8×10⁻⁹; OR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.15), implicating biologically plausible candidate genes, including RPL7, CPAMD8, PRG2, and PRG3. In all, the 16 replicated and newly discovered loci, in addition to the three coding NOD2 variants, accounted for 11.2\% of the total genetic variance for CD risk in the AJ population. This study demonstrates the complementary value of genetic studies in the Ashkenazim.},

Early identification of these low-risk patients may allow for a less aggressive therapeutic approach and possible reduction of therapy-associated risks. The aim of this project was to identify the genetic predictors of benign UC phenotype. METHODS: UC patients were selected from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium. Benign phenotype was defined as no need for immunomodulatory or biological therapy, hospitalizations, or colectomy. The association between benign UC phenotype and known loci linked to the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was evaluated. The results for 156 index single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the known IBD loci were extracted for the main analysis. The association of the benign phenotype to a genetic burden score was also evaluated. RESULTS: None of the index SNPs from the IBD loci reached the predefined threshold of 1 × 10. In the exploratory analysis of the remaining Immunochip SNPs and imputed major histocompatibility complex data, 5 distinct suggestive association signals are identified (rs1697950, rs2523639, rs17836409, rs11742854, and rs75001121). CONCLUSIONS: No SNPs from IBD susceptibility loci were found to be associated (at our predefined threshold of 1 × 10) with a benign UC disease course. The rs11742570 variant on chromosome 5 was the one with the greatest association to benign disease although the association did not reach the predefined significant threshold. Given the modest power of our study, the findings suggested on the exploratory analysis merit extension to larger discovery cohorts.},

Surprisingly, these new data point towards a critical role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. A single common coding variant in the autophagy protein ATG16L1 predisposes individuals to the development of Crohn's disease: while ATG16L1 encoding threonine at amino acid position 300 (ATG16L1*300T) confers protection, ATG16L1 encoding for alanine instead of threonine (ATG16L1*300A, also known as T300A) mediates risk towards the development of Crohn's disease. Here we report that, in human epithelial cells, the Crohn's disease-associated ATG16L1 coding variant shows impairment in the capture of internalized Salmonella within autophagosomes. Thus, we propose that the association of ATG16L1*300A with increased risk of Crohn's disease is due to impaired bacterial handling and lowered rates of bacterial capture by autophagy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) presumably caused by dysregulated immune responses to the gut microbiota. Genetic association studies have implicated dozens of chromosomal regions or loci in IBD susceptibility. The next challenge is to explain the individual role of each of these modest effect loci in the disease state. We have previously identified MAST3 as an IBD susceptibility gene through genetic fine-mapping of the 19p linkage region. Testing MAST3 in a reporter assay provided preliminary evidence that MAST3 modulates the activity of inflammation-related transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B. METHODS: Here we characterized the function of MAST3 through an examination of the influence of the modulation of MAST3 expression on endogenous genome-wide expression patterns. More specifically, we looked at differential gene expression resulting from overexpression and knockdown of the MAST3 gene in epithelial and macrophage cell lines. From we highlight a group of genes whose expression is modulated by MAST3 and correlate their expression with NF-jB activity. Their expression was found to be enriched in inflamed mucosal tissue of UC patients, confirming the importance of these genes in IBD. RESULTS: We highlight a group of genes whose expression is modulated by MAST3 and correlate their expression with NF-κB activity. Their expression was found to be enriched in inflamed mucosal tissue of UC patients, confirming the importance of these genes in IBD. These MAST3-regulated genes are central to mucosal immune responses. Among them are proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., CCL20, IL8), regulators of NF-κB (e.g., TNFAIP3, LY96, NFKBIA), genes involved in interferon-induced defense against pathogen invasion (e.g., IFIT1, ISG15), and genes involved in cell adhesion and/or migration (e.g., CD44, TMOD1). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results confirm MAST3 as a modulator of the inflammatory response through regulation of immune gene expression in the gut of IBD patients.},

Significant advances in the study of genetic susceptibility have highlighted the importance of the innate immune system in this disease. We previously completed a genome-wide linkage study and found a significant locus (IBD6) on chromosome 19p. We were interested in identifying the causal variant in IBD6. We performed a two-stage association mapping study. In stage 1, 1530 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected from the HapMap database and genotyped in 761 patients with IBD. Among the SNPs that passed the threshold for replication, 26 were successfully genotyped in 754 additional patients (stage 2). One intronic variant, rs273506, located in the microtubule-associated serine/threonine-protein kinase gene-3 (MAST3), was found to be associated in both stages (pooled P=1.8 x 10(-4)). We identified four MAST3 coding variants, including a non-synonymous SNP rs8108738, correlated to rs273506 and associated with IBD. To test whether MAST3 was expressed in cells of interest, we performed expression assays, which showed abundant expression of MAST3 in antigen-presenting cells and in lymphocytes. The knockdown of MAST3 specifically decreased Toll-like receptor-4-dependent NF-kappaB activity. Our findings are additional proofs of the pivotal role played by modulators of NF-kappaB activity in IBD pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In classifying Crohn's disease (CD) location, proximal (L4) disease includes esophagogastroduodenal (EGD) and jejunal disease. Our aim was to determine the influence of proximal disease on outcomes of behavior and need for surgery and to determine if there was significant clinical heterogeneity between EGD and jejunal disease. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional query of the NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease) Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) database of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CD and phenotyped per the IBDGC manual. Presence of any L4, L4-EGD, L4-jejunal, and non-L4 disease (L1-ileal, L2-colonic, and L3-ileocolonic) was compared with demographic features including age, race, ethnicity, smoking and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) family history, diagnosis age, disease duration, clinical outcomes of inflammatory, stricturing or penetrating behavior, and CD abdominal surgeries. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed with R. RESULTS: Among 2,105 patients with complete disease location data, 346 had L4 disease (175 L4-EGD, 115 L4-jejunal, and 56 EGD and jejunal) with 321 having concurrent L1-L3 disease. In all, 1,759 had only L1-L3 disease. L4 vs. non-L4 patients were more likely (P{$<$}0.001) to be younger at diagnosis, non-smokers, have coexisting ileal involvement, and have stricturing disease. L4-jejunal vs. L4-EGD patients were at least twice as likely (P{$<$}0.001) to have had ileal disease, stricturing behavior, and any or multiple abdominal surgeries. Remarkably, L4-jejunal patients had more (P{$<$}0.001) stricturing behavior and multiple abdominal surgeries than non-L4 ileal disease patients. Logistic regression showed stricturing risks were ileal (without proximal) site (odds ratio (OR) 3.18; 95\% confidence interval 2.23-4.64), longer disease duration (OR 1.33/decade; 1.19-1.49), jejunal site (OR 2.90; 1.89-4.45), and older age at diagnosis (OR 1.21/decade; 1.10-1.34). Multiple surgery risks were disease duration (OR 3.74/decade; 3.05-4.64), penetrating disease (OR 2.60; 1.64-4.21), and jejunal site (OR 2.39; 1.36-4.20), with short duration from diagnosis to first surgery protective (OR 0.87/decade to first surgery; 0.84-0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Jejunal disease is a significantly greater risk factor for stricturing disease and multiple abdominal surgeries than either EGD or ileal (without proximal) disease. The Montreal site classification should be revised to include separate designations for jejunal and EGD disease.},

Nonetheless, the mechanisms governing immunity to gut fungal communities (mycobiota) remain unknown. We identified CX3CR1+ mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) as being essential for the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses to intestinal fungi. CX3CR1+ MNPs express antifungal receptors and activate antifungal responses in a Syk-dependent manner. Genetic ablation of CX3CR1+ MNPs in mice led to changes in gut fungal communities and to severe colitis that was rescued by antifungal treatment. In Crohn's disease patients, a missense mutation in the gene encoding CX3CR1 was identified and found to be associated with impaired antifungal responses. These results unravel a role of CX3CR1+ MNPs in mediating interactions between intestinal mycobiota and host immunity at steady state and during inflammatory disease.},

  abstract = {Autoimmune diseases occur when an individual's own immune system attacks and destroys his or her healthy cells and tissues. Although it is clear that environmental stimuli can predispose someone to develop autoimmune diseases, twin- and family-based studies have shown that genetic factors also play an important role in modifying disease risk. Because many of these diseases are relatively common (prevalence in European-derived populations: 0.01-1\%) and exhibit a complex mode of inheritance, many DNA sequence variants with modest effect on disease risk contribute to the genetic burden. Recently, the completion of the HapMap project, together with the development of new genotyping technologies, has given human geneticists the tools necessary to comprehensively, and in an unbiased manner, search our genome for DNA polymorphisms associated with many autoimmune diseases. Here we review recent progress made in the identification of genetic risk factors for celiac disease, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and type-1 diabetes using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Strikingly, GWAS have increased the number of genetic risk variants associated with these autoimmune diseases from 15 before 2006 to 68 now. We summarize what this new genetic landscape teaches us in terms of the pathogenesis of these diseases, and highlight some of the outstanding challenges ahead. Finally, we open a discussion on ways to best maximize the impact of these genetic discoveries where it matters the most, that is for autoimmune disease patients.},

  abstract = {AIM: To study the type and frequency of adverse events associated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy and evaluate for any serologic and genetic associations. METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of patients attending the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) centers at Cedars-Sinai IBD Center from 2005-2016. Adverse events were identified via chart review. IBD serologies were measured by ELISA. DNA samples were genotyped at Cedars-Sinai using Illumina Infinium Immunochipv1 array per manufacturer's protocol. SNPs underwent methodological review and were evaluated using several SNP statistic parameters to ensure optimal allele-calling. Standard and rigorous QC criteria were applied to the genetic data, which was generated using immunochip. Genetic association was assessed by logistic regression after correcting for population structure. RESULTS: Altogether we identified 1258 IBD subjects exposed to anti-TNF agents in whom Immunochip data were available. 269/1258 patients (21\%) were found to have adverse events to an anti-TNF-α agent that required the therapy to be discontinued. 25\% of women compared to 17\% of men experienced an adverse event. All adverse events resolved after discontinuing the anti-TNF agent. In total: n = 66 (5\%) infusion reactions; n = 49 (4\%) allergic/serum sickness reactions; n = 19 (1.5\%) lupus-like reactions, n = 52 (4\%) rash, n = 18 (1.4\%) infections. In Crohn's disease, IgA ASCA (P = 0.04) and IgG-ASCA (P = 0.02) levels were also lower in patients with any adverse events, and anti-I2 level in ulcerative colitis was significantly associated with infusion reactions (P = 0.008). The logistic regression/human annotation and network analyses performed on the Immunochip data implicated the following five signaling pathways: JAK-STAT (Janus Kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription), measles, IBD, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and toxoplasmosis for any adverse event. CONCLUSION: Our study shows 1 in 5 IBD patients experience an adverse event to anti-TNF therapy with novel serologic, genetic , and pathways associations.},

We aim to define etiologically more homogenous subgroups in CD based on ages of onset. Methods: We examined the distribution of CD polygenetic risk score (PRS) across ages of diagnosis in a Caucasian cohort of 2344 independent CD patients. We identified subgroups with a distinct distribution of PRS and compared those groups in genetics, demographic characteristics, clinical subphenotypes, and serological markers. The results were replicated in an independent cohort of 13,065 CD patients from the International Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Genetic Consortium (IIBDGC). Results: We identified a late-onset (LO) subgroup in CD (age at diagnosis ≥ 55 years) with significantly lower PRS compared with the intermediate group (age at diagnosis between 5 and 55 years) in both cohorts. Smoking cessation, a risk factor for ulcerative colitis (UC) and protective factor for CD, had a higher rate in this LO subgroup in comparison with the intermediate group. We also compared the LO group with the intermediate group, and, consistent with previous reports, the LO group more often had colonic CD, had less penetrating disease behavior, and had less need for surgery. Serological analysis showed that LO CD patients were more antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positive and less antisaccharomyces cerevisiae antibody positive compared with the intermediate group. Variance component analysis indicated that overall genetic contribution to LO CD was lower relative to the middle group, and genetic heterogeneity testing indicated that LO CD was different from the middle group in underlying genetic architecture. Conclusions: Late-onset CD is subgroup distinct in genetic and behavioral risk factors with UC-like characteristics. 10.1093/ibd/izy148\_video1izy148.video15791413461001.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Interactions between mucosal cell types, environmental stressors, and intestinal microbiota contribute to pathogenesis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here, we applied metaproteomics of the mucosal-luminal interface to study the disease-related biology of the human colonic mucosa. METHODS: We recruited a discovery cohort of 51 IBD and non-IBD subjects endoscopically sampled by mucosal lavage at~6 colonic regions, and a validation cohort of 38 no-IBD subjects. Metaproteome data sets were produced for each sample and analyzed for association with colonic site and disease state using a suite of bioinformatic approaches. Localization of select proteins was determined by immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemistry of human endoscopic biopsy samples. RESULTS: Co-occurrence analysis of the discovery cohort metaproteome showed that proteins at the mucosal surface clustered into modules with evidence of differential functional specialization (eg, iron regulation, microbial defense) and cellular origin (eg, epithelial or hemopoietic). These modules, validated in an independent cohort, were differentially associated spatially along the gastrointestinal tract, and 7 modules were associated selectively with non-IBD, ulcerative colitis, and/or Crohn's disease states. In addition, the detailed composition of certain modules was altered in disease vs healthy states. We confirmed the predicted spatial and disease-associated localization of 28 proteins representing 4 different disease-related modules by immunoblot and immunohistochemistry visualization, with evidence for their distribution as millimeter-scale microgeographic mosaic. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the mucosal surface is a microgeographic mosaic of functional networks reflecting the local mucosal ecology, whose compositional differences in disease and healthy samples may provide a unique readout of physiologic and pathologic mucosal states.},

They are capable of expressing diverse killer Ig-like receptors (KIRs), and KIRs are implicated in susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic intestinal inflammatory disease. However, the cellular mechanism of this genetic contribution is unknown. In this study, we show that the "licensing" of NK cells, determined by the presence of KIR2DL3 and homozygous HLA-C1 in host genome, results in their cytokine reprogramming, which permits them to promote CD4(+) T cell activation and Th17 differentiation ex vivo. Microfluidic analysis of thousands of NK single cells and bulk secretions established that licensed NK cells are more polarized to proinflammatory cytokine production than unlicensed NK cells, including production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, CCL-5, and MIP-1β. Cytokines produced by licensed NK augmented CD4(+) T cell proliferation and IL-17A/IL-22 production. Ab blocking indicated a primary role for IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6 in the augmented T cell-proliferative response. In conclusion, NK licensing mediated by KIR2DL2/3 and HLA-C1 elicits a novel NK cytokine program that activates and induces proinflammatory CD4(+) T cells, thereby providing a potential biologic mechanism for KIR-associated susceptibility to CD and other chronic inflammatory diseases.},

Here, we aimed to identify novel associations between IBD and functional genetic variants using the Illumina ExomeChip (San Diego, CA). METHODS: Genotyping was performed in 10,523 IBD cases and 5726 non-IBD controls. There were 91,713 functional single-nucleotide polymorphism loci in coding regions analyzed. A novel identified association was replicated further in 2 independent cohorts. We further examined the association of the identified single-nucleotide polymorphism with microbiota from 338 mucosal lavage samples in the Mucosal Luminal Interface cohort measured using 16S sequencing. RESULTS: We identified an association between CD and a missense variant encoding alanine or threonine at position 391 in the zinc transporter solute carrier family 39, member 8 protein (SLC39A8 alanine 391 threonine, rs13107325) and replicated the association with CD in 2 replication cohorts (combined meta-analysis P~= 5.55~× 10(-13)). This variant has been associated previously with distinct phenotypes including obesity, lipid levels, blood pressure, and schizophrenia. We subsequently determined that the CD risk allele was associated with altered colonic mucosal microbiome composition in both healthy controls (P~= .009) and CD cases~(P~= .0009). Moreover, microbes depleted in healthy~carriers strongly overlap with those reduced in CD patients (P~=~9.24~× 10(-16)) and overweight individuals (P~=~6.73~×~10(-16)).

Despite comorbidity with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in 72\% of the cases, 6 of the 12 loci showed significantly stronger association with PSC than with IBD, suggesting overlapping yet distinct genetic architectures for these two diseases. We incorporated association statistics from 7 diseases clinically occurring with PSC in the analysis and found suggestive evidence for 33 additional pleiotropic PSC risk loci. Together with network analyses, these findings add to the genetic risk map of PSC and expand on the relationship between PSC and other immune-mediated diseases.},

  abstract = {It is suggested that subtyping of complex inflammatory diseases can be based on genetic susceptibility and relevant environmental exposure (G+E). We propose that using matched cellular phenotypes in human subjects and corresponding preclinical models with the same G+E combinations is useful to this end. As an example, defective Paneth cells can subtype Crohn's disease (CD) subjects; Paneth cell defects have been linked to multiple CD susceptibility genes and are associated with poor outcome. We hypothesized that CD susceptibility genes interact with cigarette smoking, a major CD environmental risk factor, to trigger Paneth cell defects. We found that both CD subjects and mice with ATG16L1T300A (T300A; a prevalent CD susceptibility allele) developed Paneth cell defects triggered by tobacco smoke. Transcriptional analysis of full-thickness ileum and Paneth cell-enriched crypt base cells showed the T300A-smoking combination altered distinct pathways, including proapoptosis, metabolic dysregulation, and selective downregulation of the PPARγ pathway. Pharmacologic intervention by either apoptosis inhibitor or PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone prevented smoking-induced crypt apoptosis and Paneth cell defects in T300A mice and mice with conditional Paneth cell-specific knockout of Atg16l1. This study demonstrates how explicit G+E can drive disease-relevant phenotype and provides rational strategies for identifying actionable targets.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated that morphologic defects of ileal Paneth cells correlate with multiple susceptible genetic variants, the presence of granuloma, and clinical outcome in Crohn's disease. These studies were performed using uninvolved areas of resection specimens. To develop Paneth cell phenotype as a prognostic biomarker in Crohn's disease, further characterization is necessary. Specifically, effects of disease activity, phenotype duration, and the minimal crypt number that would allow for accurate Paneth cell phenotyping are unknown. METHODS: We compared Paneth cell phenotypes in (1) 46 cases with paired involved and uninvolved sections; (2) 36 cases with multiple ileal resections over time; (3) "virtual biopsies" by randomly selecting 10 to 60 crypts from 85 surgical cases where 250 crypts had been analyzed; and (4) 26 cases with resection and biopsy performed within 1 year. RESULTS: In paired resection specimens, the Paneth cell phenotypes in the uninvolved areas correlated with those seen in involved areas (P {$<$} 0.0001) and also predicted the presence of granuloma (P = 0.042). Importantly, the Paneth cell phenotype remained stable over time (P {$<$} 0.0001). By mathematical analyses, a minimum of 40 crypts was required to generate results equivalent to those using resection specimens. Finally, there was good correlation in Paneth cell phenotypes in biopsy specimens and resection specimens obtained within 1 year (P = 0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: Accurate Paneth cell phenotypes can be assessed using biopsy materials with the caveat that sufficient well-oriented crypts exist in the specimen. This advance will extend the potential clinical application of this novel stratification platform.},

  abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases, which include Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, affect several million individuals worldwide. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are complex diseases that are heterogeneous at the clinical, immunological, molecular, genetic, and microbial levels. Individual contributing factors have been the focus of extensive research. As part of the Integrative Human Microbiome Project (HMP2 or iHMP), we followed 132 subjects for one year each to generate integrated longitudinal molecular profiles of host and microbial activity during disease (up to 24 time points each; in total 2,965 stool, biopsy, and blood specimens). Here we present the results, which provide a comprehensive view of functional dysbiosis in the gut microbiome during inflammatory bowel disease activity. We demonstrate a characteristic increase in facultative anaerobes at the expense of obligate anaerobes, as well as molecular disruptions in microbial transcription (for example, among clostridia), metabolite pools (acylcarnitines, bile acids, and short-chain fatty acids), and levels of antibodies in host serum. Periods of disease activity were also marked by increases in temporal variability, with characteristic taxonomic, functional, and biochemical shifts. Finally, integrative analysis identified microbial, biochemical, and host factors central to this dysregulation. The study's infrastructure resources, results, and data, which are available through the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multi'omics Database ( http://ibdmdb.org ), provide the most comprehensive description to date of host and microbial activities in inflammatory bowel diseases.},

We found that a subset of patients expressed a unique cellular module in inflamed tissues that consisted of IgG plasma cells, inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes, activated T~cells, and stromal cells, which we named the GIMATS module. Analysis of ligand-receptor interaction pairs identified a distinct network connectivity that likely drives the GIMATS module. Strikingly, the GIMATS module was also present in a subset of patients in four independent iCD cohorts (n~= 441), and its presence at diagnosis correlated with failure to achieve durable corticosteroid-free remission upon anti-TNF therapy. These results emphasize the limitations of current diagnostic assays and the potential for single-cell mapping tools to identify novel biomarkers of treatment response and tailored therapeutic opportunities.},

Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with SNPs around IRGM, but coding-sequence variation has been excluded as a source of this association. We identified a common, 20-kb deletion polymorphism, immediately upstream of IRGM and in perfect linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 1.0) with the most strongly CD-associated SNP, that causes IRGM to segregate in the population with two distinct upstream sequences. The deletion (CD risk) and reference (CD protective) haplotypes of IRGM showed distinct expression patterns. Manipulation of IRGM expression levels modulated cellular autophagy of internalized bacteria, a process implicated in CD. These results suggest that the CD association at IRGM arises from an alteration in IRGM regulation that affects the efficacy of autophagy and identify a common deletion polymorphism as a likely causal variant.},

We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 896 CD cases and 3204 healthy controls all of Caucasian origin as defined by multidimensional scaling. We found supportive evidence for 21 out of 40 CD loci identified in a recent CD GWAS meta-analysis, including two loci which had only nominally achieved replication (rs4807569, 19p13; rs991804, CCL2/CCL7). In addition, we identified associations with genes involved in tight junctions/epithelial integrity (ASHL, ARPC1A), innate immunity (EXOC2), dendritic cell biology [CADM1 (IGSF4)], macrophage development (MMD2), TGF-beta signaling (MAP3K7IP1) and FUT2 (a physiological trait that regulates gastrointestinal mucosal expression of blood group A and B antigens) (rs602662, P=3.4x10(-5)). Twenty percent of Caucasians are 'non-secretors' who do not express ABO antigens in saliva as a result of the FUT2 W134X allele. We demonstrated replication in an independent cohort of 1174 CD cases and 357 controls between the four primary FUT2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CD (rs602662, combined P-value 4.90x10(-8)) and also association with FUT2 W143X (P=2.6x10(-5)). Further evidence of the relevance of this locus to CD pathogenesis was demonstrated by the association of the original four SNPs and CD in the recently published CD GWAS meta-analysis (rs602662, P=0.001). These findings strongly implicate this locus in CD susceptibility and highlight the role of the mucus layer in the development of CD.},

Genetic variants in the IL23R and IL12B have been associated with CD susceptibility. We investigated 10 genes within the IL23/IL17 pathway in a case-control study of 763 CD cases and 254 healthy controls. METHODS: We identified a novel association in haplotypes in IL17A (empirical P = 0.02), IL17RA (P = 0.001), IL17RD (P = 0.001), IL12RB1 (P = 0.003), and IL12RB2 (P = 0.001) as well as confirming the association with IL12B variants (P = 0.003). RESULTS: The cumulative risk for carrying an increased number of CD risk haplotypes from genes in this pathway rises to an odds ratio of 4.3 for carrying 5 risk haplotypes. We have previously demonstrated an association between this cohort and IL23R haplotypes. Pairwise analyses suggest that there is statistical interaction between variants in IL17A and IL23R (P = 0.047) and between variants in IL17RA and IL23R (P = 0.036). Furthermore, a significant association between CD and the widely replicated IL23R variants is only seen in the presence of IL17A or IL17RA variants. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the investigation of pathways implicated in CD pathogenesis in order to identify further susceptibility genes and also suggest that important gene-gene interaction is present in CD susceptibility.(Inflamm Bowel Dis 2009).},

Fifty-nine SNPs from 14 independent loci attained an association significance of P {$<$} 10(-5). Seven of these loci exceeded genome-wide significance (P {$<$} 5 x 10(-8)).

We confirmed association with 14 previously identified ulcerative colitis susceptibility loci, and an analysis of acknowledged Crohn's disease loci showed that roughly half of the known Crohn's disease associations are shared with ulcerative colitis. These data implicate approximately 30 loci in ulcerative colitis, thereby providing insight into disease pathogenesis.},

This study investigated differential expression of miRNAs across clinical phenotypes in a well-characterized cohort of IBD patients and healthy controls [HCs]. Methods: A cohort of Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC] patients and HCs was prospectively accrued. Total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells for all subjects. miRNA expression was measured using NanoString technologies. The subjects were stratified according to disease activity and location. Statistical significance was assessed per miRNA across outcomes and corrected for multiple testing. miRNA regulation of transcription of important results was confirmed in vitro by a dual luciferase reporter assay and autophagy function was evaluated using immunofluorescence imaging of LC3 puncta in HeLa cells. Results: In total, 120 subjects were enrolled. Seventy-four miRNAs were differentially expressed across CD, UC and HCs. Comparing quiescent CD [CDq] with HCs we found ten miRNAs upregulated in CDq. When comparing colonic CD [CCD] to UC, seven miRNAs were upregulated in CCD. The most differentially expressed miRNA in CCD vs UC was miR-874-3p, and we showed its possible utility as a biomarker of differential diagnosis. We showed miR-874-3p targets ATG16L1 and reduces its expression in vitro. An miR-874-3p mimic dysregulates autophagy by a reduction of LC3 in vitro. Conclusions: We identified unique miRNA signatures expressed in distinct IBD phenotypes. These associations highlight pathways dysregulated by aberrant miRNA expression, revealing possible mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of IBD, but also suggest a cluster of miRNAs as readily accessible biomarkers to aid in differential diagnosis.},

In this study we analysed differential miRNA expression between CD and healthy subjects across ileal and colonic tissues. A cohort of CD and healthy control (HC) subjects was recruited and clinical data collected. Endoscopically quiescent CD (CDq) was defined as inactive or mild by the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD. Total RNA was extracted from endoscopic biopsies taken from the terminal ileum and sigmoid colon. miRNA expression was quantified using NanoString Technologies. Statistical significance was assessed across biopsy site and diagnosis per miRNA and corrected for multiple testing. In total, 23 CDq and 38 HC subjects were enrolled. 112 samples were included in the analysis, 51 from the ileum and 61 from the colon. We found 47 miRNAs differentially expressed by biopsy site in healthy tissue. Nine miRNAs were differentially expressed across HC and CDq accounting for biopsy location. One of these, miR-223-3p, showed age and sex effects. We identified miRNA expression driven by diagnosis targeting genes involved in chemokine and cytokine signalling. miR-31-5p expression was driven by location and may be a biomarker for location subtypes in CD. We identified differentially expressed miRNAs in healthy ileal and colonic tissues. We discovered spatial miRNA expression patterns in CD and HC suggesting site-specific regulation in subjects with no or minimal intestinal inflammation.

  abstract = {Polymorphisms in C1orf106 are associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the function of C1orf106 and the consequences of disease-associated polymorphisms are unknown. Here we demonstrate that C1orf106 regulates adherens junction stability by regulating the degradation of cytohesin-1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that controls activation of ARF6. By limiting cytohesin-1-dependent ARF6 activation, C1orf106 stabilizes adherens junctions. Consistent with this model, C1orf106-/- mice exhibit defects in the intestinal epithelial cell barrier, a phenotype observed in IBD patients that confers increased susceptibility to intestinal pathogens. Furthermore, the IBD risk variant increases C1orf106 ubiquitination and turnover with consequent functional impairments. These findings delineate a mechanism by which a genetic polymorphism fine-tunes intestinal epithelial barrier integrity and elucidate a fundamental mechanism of cellular junctional control.},

Genetic mutations in genes encoding components of the complex result in both X-linked and autosomal recessive forms of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD).

The aim of this study is to determine if polymorphisms in NOX2 NADPH oxidase complex genes that do not  cause CGD are associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Direct sequencing and candidate gene approaches were used to identify susceptibility loci in NADPH oxidase complex genes. Functional studies were carried out on identified variants.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: RAC1 is a guanosine triphosphatase that has an evolutionarily  conserved role in coordinating immune defenses, from plants to mammals. Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases are associated with dysregulation of immune defenses. We studied the role of RAC1 in inflammatory bowel diseases using human genetic and functional studies and animal models of colitis. METHODS: We used a candidate gene approach to HapMap-Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms in a discovery cohort; findings were confirmed in 2 additional cohorts. RAC1 messenger RNA expression was examined from peripheral blood cells of patients. Colitis was induced in mice with conditional disruption of Rac1 in phagocytes by administration of dextran sulfate sodium. RESULTS: We observed a genetic association between RAC1 with ulcerative colitis in a discovery cohort, 2 independent replication cohorts, and in combined analysis for the single nucleotide polymorphisms rs10951982 (P(combined UC) = 3.3 x 10(-8), odds ratio =  1.43 [95\% confidence interval: 1.26-1.63]) and rs4720672 (P(combined UC) = 4.7 x  10(-6), odds ratio = 1.36 [95\% confidence interval: 1.19-1.58]). Patients with inflammatory bowel disease who had the rs10951982 risk allele had increased expression of RAC1 compared to those without this allele. Conditional disruption  of Rac1 in macrophage and neutrophils of mice protected against dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Human studies and knockout mice demonstrated a role for the guanosine triphosphatase RAC1 in the development of ulcerative colitis; increased expression of RAC1 was associated with susceptibility to colitis.},

Crosstalk between activated myeloid and stromal cells is critical in pathogenicity1,2 with increases in intravasating monocytes correlated to anti-TNF treatment non-response3. The highest effect risk alleles are loss-of-function NOD24,5 mutations, which increase risk for stricturing6. However, mechanisms underlying NOD2-pathogenicity and salvage pathways in anti-TNF refractory patients remain largely uncharacterized. Here we show that NOD2 loss leads to dysregulated activated fibroblast and macrophage homeostasis by direct ex vivo analyses of patients carrying NOD2 risk alleles. CD14+PBMCs from NOD2 carriers produce collagen-high expressing cells, and elevation of conserved signatures is observed in nod2-deficient zebrafish models of intestinal injury. Enrichment of STAT3 regulation and gp130-ligands in activated fibroblasts and macrophages led us to reason that gp130 blockade might rescue the activated program. We correlate post-treatment induction of this pathway in anti-TNF non-responders and demonstrate in vivo amelioration of the activated myeloid-stromal niche, using a specific gp130 inhibitor, bazedoxifene. Our results demonstrate novel biological insights into NOD2-driven fibrosis in CD; gp130 blockade may benefit selected CD patients, potentially complementing anti-TNF therapy.},

This study was undertaken to characterize racial differences in disease phenotype in a predominantly adult population. METHODS: Phenotype data on 830 non-Hispanic white, 127 non-Hispanic African American, and 169 Hispanic IBD patients, recruited from six academic centers, were abstracted from medical records and compiled in the NIDDK-IBD Genetics Consortium repository. We characterized racial differences in family history, disease location and behavior, surgical history, and extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) using standardized definitions. RESULTS: African American CD patients were more likely  than whites to develop esophagogastroduodenal CD (OR = 2.8; 95\% CI: 1.4-5.5), colorectal disease (OR = 1.9; 95\% CI: 1.1-3.4), perianal disease (OR = 1.7; 95\% CI: 1.03-2.8), but less likely to have ileal involvement (OR = 0.55; 95\% CI: 0.32-0.96). They were also at higher risk for uveitis (OR = 5.5; 95\% CI: 2.3-13.0) and sacroiliitis (OR = 4.0; 95\% CI: 1.55-10.1). Hispanics had higher prevalence of perianal CD (OR = 2.9; 95\% CI: 1.8-4.6) and erythema nodosum (3.3;  95\% CI: 1.7-6.4). Among UC patients, Hispanics had more proximal disease extent.  Both African American and Hispanic CD patients, but not UC patients, had lower prevalences of family history of IBD than their white counterparts. CONCLUSIONS:  There are racial differences in IBD family history, disease location, and EIMs that may reflect underlying genetic variations and have important implications for diagnosis and management of disease. These findings underscore the need for further studies in minority populations.},

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of Black (n = 120) and White (n = 115) IBD patients recruited from an outpatient IBD clinic. Self-reported adherence to taking medication and keeping appointments, trust-in-physician, and health-related quality of life were measured using the validated instruments, the modified Hill-Bone Compliance Scale (HBCS), the Trust-in-Physician Scale (TIPS), and the Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ), respectively. RESULTS: Overall adherence was 65\%. Higher adherence correlated with greater trust-in-physician (r = -0.30; P {$<$} 0.0001), increasing age (r = -0.19; P = 0.01), and worsening health-related quality of life (r = -0.18; P = 0.01). Adherence was also higher among White IBD patients compared to Blacks (HBSC: 15.6 versus 14.0, P {$<$} 0.0001). Trust-in-physician, race, and age remained predictors of adherence to medical management after adjustment for employment, income, health insurance, marital and socioeconomic status, and immunomodulator therapy. The adjusted odds ratio for adherence in Blacks compared to Whites was 0.29 (95\% confidence interval: 0.13-0.64). Every half standard deviation increase in trust-in-physician and every incremental decade in age were associated with 36\% and 47\% higher likelihood of adherence, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Trust-in-physician is a potentially modifiable predictor of adherence to IBD medical therapy. Black IBD patients exhibited lower adherence compared to their White counterparts.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronically relapsing disorder that leads to significant morbidity and, in most cases, surgery. Our objective was to characterize health disparities in CD-related bowel resection among hospitalized CD patients. METHODS: We analyzed discharge records from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, the largest nationally representative database of acute-care hospitals throughout the United States. A total of 41,918 discharges with CD from 1998 to 2003 were included. Bowel resection and in-hospital mortality rates for non-Hispanic whites, African Americans, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Asians were calculated. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, sex, health insurance, comorbidity, median neighborhood income, and hospital characteristics, the relative rate ratio of undergoing bowel resection for African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians compared to whites was 0.68 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.61-0.76), 0.70 (95\% CI: 0.60-0.83), and 0.31 (95\% CI: 0.16-0.59), respectively. Compared to those with private insurance, the relative risk of surgery for those with Medicare, those with Medicaid, and those who were "self-pay" was 0.48 (95\% CI: 0.44-0.54), 0.52 (95\% CI: 0.46-0.59), and 0.67 (95\% CI: 0.58-0.77), respectively. Women were less likely than men to undergo bowel resection (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.80; 95\% CI: 0.76-0.85). The in-hospital mortality of individuals who resided in neighborhoods whose median income was above the national median was lower (IRR = 0.71; 95\% CI: 0.50-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Bowel resection among hospitalized CD patients varies by race, health insurance, and sex.

We adjusted racial comparisons for demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical factors. RESULTS: After adjustment for confounders, blacks were less likely than whites to be under the regular care (defined as at least annual visit) of a gastroenterologist (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.43; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.25-0.75) or IBD specialist (aOR 0.37; 95\% CI: 0.22-0.61). Follow-up with a primary care provider was, however, similar between blacks and whites. Over the preceding 12 months, blacks were more likely than whites to have at least one visit to the ED (aOR 2.02; 95\% CI: 1.22-3.35), but there was no difference in hospitalization. Among CD patients with prolonged steroid use, blacks were less likely than whites to have been on infliximab (aOR 0.41; 95\% CI: 0.21-0.77), but there were no racial differences in the use of immunomodulators (aOR 0.87; 95\% CI: 0.48-1.60).

The objectives of this study are to determine whether disparities also exist for the use of parenteral nutrition (PN) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: The U.S. Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 1998 and 2003 is analyzed to determine PN use among IBD inpatients diagnosed with protein-calorie malnutrition and assess whether use patterns differ by race and geographical region. RESULTS: The proportion of African American IBD admissions with protein-calorie malnutrition who receive PN is significantly lower than that in whites (19.9\% vs 28.1\%, P = .001), whereas there is no difference between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites. After adjustment for gender, comorbidity, health insurance status, geographic region, and median neighborhood income, African Americans remain less likely than whites to receive PN (odds ratio [OR] 0.67; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.89), whereas the difference between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites is marginally significant (OR 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.41-1.04). PN use varies geographically, with highest rates in the Northeast (44.3\%) and lowest in the Midwest (17.3\%). Uninsured patients are less than half as likely to receive PN as those with insurance (OR 0.46; 95\% CI, 0.31-0.69). Compared with whites, Hispanics experience a longer time interval between admission and initiation of PN (3.5 vs 4.8 days, P = .02) and have higher rates of catheter-related complications (5.1\% vs 12.2\%, P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Among IBD inpatients with clinically diagnosable malnutrition, PN use is lower among African Americans compared with whites.

  abstract = {Decreases in the diversity of enteric bacterial populations are observed in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Less is known about the virome in these diseases. We show that the enteric virome is abnormal in CD and UC patients. In-depth analysis of preparations enriched for free virions in the intestine revealed that CD and UC were associated with a significant expansion of Caudovirales bacteriophages. The viromes of CD and UC patients were disease and cohort specific. Importantly, it did not appear that expansion and diversification of the enteric virome was secondary to changes in bacterial populations. These data support a model in which changes in the virome may contribute to intestinal inflammation and bacterial dysbiosis. We conclude that the virome is a candidate for contributing to, or being a biomarker for, human inflammatory bowel disease and speculate that the enteric virome may play a role in other diseases.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a heterogeneous group of conditions unified by the presence of chronic childhood arthritis without an identifiable cause. Systemic JIA (sJIA) is a rare form of JIA characterised by systemic inflammation. sJIA is distinguished from other forms of JIA by unique clinical features and treatment responses that are similar to autoinflammatory diseases. However, approximately half of children with sJIA develop destructive,  long-standing arthritis that appears similar to other forms of JIA. Using genomic approaches, we sought to gain novel insights into the pathophysiology of sJIA and its relationship with other forms of JIA. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study of 770 children with sJIA collected in nine countries by the International Childhood Arthritis Genetics Consortium. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were tested for association with sJIA. Weighted genetic risk scores were used to compare the genetic architecture of sJIA with other JIA subtypes. RESULTS: The major histocompatibility complex locus and a locus on chromosome 1 each showed association with sJIA exceeding the threshold for genome-wide significance, while 23 other novel loci were suggestive of association with sJIA. Using a combination of genetic and statistical approaches, we found no evidence of shared genetic architecture between sJIA and other common JIA subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of shared genetic risk factors between sJIA and other JIA subtypes supports the hypothesis that sJIA is a unique disease process and argues for a different classification framework. Research to improve sJIA therapy should target its unique genetics and specific pathophysiological pathways.},

  abstract = {Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) is an often severe, potentially life-threatening childhood inflammatory disease, the pathophysiology of which is  poorly understood. To determine whether genetic variation within the MHC locus on chromosome 6 influences sJIA susceptibility, we performed an association study of 982 children with sJIA and 8,010 healthy control subjects from nine countries. Using meta-analysis of directly observed and imputed SNP genotypes and imputed classic HLA types, we identified the MHC locus as a bona fide susceptibility locus with effects on sJIA risk that transcended geographically defined strata. The strongest sJIA-associated SNP, rs151043342 [P = 2.8 x 10(-17), odds ratio (OR) 2.6 (2.1, 3.3)], was part of a cluster of 482 sJIA-associated SNPs that spanned a 400-kb region and included the class II HLA region. Conditional analysis controlling for the effect of rs151043342 found that rs12722051 independently influenced sJIA risk [P = 1.0 x 10(-5), OR 0.7 (0.6, 0.8)]. Meta-analysis of imputed classic HLA-type associations in six study populations of Western European ancestry revealed that HLA-DRB1*11 and its defining amino acid residue, glutamate 58, were strongly associated with sJIA [P = 2.7 x 10(-16), OR 2.3 (1.9, 2.8)], as was the HLA-DRB1*11-HLA-DQA1*05-HLA-DQB1*03 haplotype [6.4 x 10(-17), OR 2.3 (1.9, 2.9)]. By examining the MHC locus in the largest collection of sJIA patients assembled to date, this study solidifies the  relationship between the class II HLA region and sJIA, implicating adaptive immune molecules in the pathogenesis of sJIA.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Genetic risk scores (GRS) have been developed that differentiate individuals with type 1 diabetes from those with other forms of diabetes and are starting to be used for population screening; however, most studies were conducted in European-ancestry populations. This study identifies novel genetic variants associated with type 1 diabetes risk in African-ancestry participants and develops an African-specific GRS. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We generated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data with the ImmunoChip on 1,021 African-ancestry participants with type 1 diabetes and 2,928 control participants. HLA class I and class II alleles were imputed using SNP2HLA. Logistic regression models were used to identify genome-wide significant (P {$<$} 5.0 × 10-8) SNPs associated with type 1 diabetes in the African-ancestry samples and validate SNPs associated with risk in known European-ancestry loci (P {$<$} 2.79 × 10-5). RESULTS: African-specific (HLA-DQA1*03:01-HLA-DQB1*02:01) and known European-ancestry HLA haplotypes (HLA-DRB1*03:01-HLA-DQA1*05:01-HLA-DQB1*02:01, HLA-DRB1*04:01-HLA-DQA1*03:01-HLA-DQB1*03:02) were significantly associated with type 1 diabetes risk. Among European-ancestry defined non-HLA risk loci, six risk loci were significantly associated with type 1 diabetes in subjects of African ancestry. An African-specific GRS provided strong prediction of type 1 diabetes risk (area under the curve 0.871), performing significantly better than a European-based GRS and two polygenic risk scores in independent discovery and validation cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic risk of type 1 diabetes includes ancestry-specific, disease-associated variants. The GRS developed here provides improved prediction of type 1 diabetes in African-ancestry subjects and a means to identify groups of individuals who would benefit from immune monitoring for early detection of islet autoimmunity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Early appendectomy is inversely associated with the development of UC. However, the impact of appendectomy on the clinical course of UC is controversial, generally favouring a milder disease course. We aim to describe the effect appendectomy has on the disease course of UC with focus on the timing of appendectomy in relation to UC diagnosis. DESIGN: Using the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium database of patients with UC, the risk of colectomy was compared between patients who did and did not undergo appendectomy. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis of studies that examined the association between appendectomy and colectomy. RESULTS: 2980 patients with UC were initially included. 111 (4.4\%) patients with UC had an appendectomy; of which 63 were performed prior to UC diagnosis and 48 after diagnosis. In multivariable analysis, appendectomy performed at any time was an independent risk factor for colectomy (OR 1.9, 95\% CI 1.1 to 3.1), with appendectomy performed after UC diagnosis most strongly associated with colectomy (OR 2.2, 95\% CI 1.1 to 4.5). An updated meta-analysis showed appendectomy performed either prior to or after UC diagnosis had no effect on colectomy rates. CONCLUSIONS: Appendectomy performed at any time in relation to UC diagnosis was not associated with a decrease in severity of disease. In fact, appendectomy after UC diagnosis may be associated with a higher risk of colectomy. These findings question the proposed use of appendectomy as treatment for UC.},

Despite a considerable non-response rate, little is known about the genetic predictors of response to anti-TNF therapy in CD. Our aim in this study was to investigate the genetic factors associated with response to anti-TNF therapy in patients with CD. METHODS: We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify loci influencing the response to IFX among Korean patients with CD, comprising 42 good responders with mucosal healing and 70 non-responders. The achievement of mucosal healing was assessed by endoscopy and imaging. The functional significance of TRAP1 (TNF receptor associated protein 1) was examined using dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis model in TRAP1 transgenic mice. RESULTS: The GWAS identified rs2158962, an intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of TRAP1, significantly associated with mucosal healing (odds ratio~=~4.94; Pcombined ~=~1.35~×~10-7 ). In the dextran sodium sulfate-induced acute colitis, TRAP1 transgenic mice showed a better response to IFX than the wild-type mice. CONCLUSIONS: The TRAP1 gene is associated with mucosal healing in CD patients following IFX therapy. Identifying the genetic predictors of mucosal healing to anti-TNF therapy can prevent patients from exposure to ineffective therapies.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims:\hspace{0.6em}Heterogeneity in Crohn’s disease [CD] provides a challenge for the development of effective therapies. Our goal was to define a unique molecular signature for severe, refractory CD to enable precision therapy approaches to disease treatment and to facilitate earlier intervention in complicated disease. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We analysed clinical metadata, genetics, and transcriptomics from uninvolved ileal tissue from CD patients who underwent a single small bowel resection. We determined transcriptional risk scores, cellular signatures, and mechanistic pathways that define patient subsets in refractory CD. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Within refractory CD, we found three CD patient subgroups [CD1, CD2, and CD3]. Compared with CD1, CD3 was enriched for subjects with increased disease recurrence after first surgery [OR = 6.78, p = 0.04], enhanced occurrence of second surgery [OR = 5.07, p = 0.016], and presence of perianal CD [OR = 3.61, p = 0.036]. The proportion of patients with recurrence-free survival was smaller in CD3 than in CD1 (p = 0.02, median survival time [months] in CD1 = 10 and CD3 = 6). Overlaying differential gene expression between CD1 and CD3 on CD subgroup-associated genetic polymorphisms identified 174 genes representing both genetic and biological differences between the CD subgroups. Pathway analyses using this unique gene signature indicated eukaryotic initiation factor 2 [eIF2] and cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP] signalling to be dominant pathways associated with CD3. Furthermore, the severe, refractory subset, CD3, was associated with a higher transcriptional risk score and enriched with eosinophil and natural killerT [NKT] cell gene signatures. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} We characterized a subset of severe, refractory CD patients who may need more aggressive treatment after first resection and who are likely to benefit from targeted therapy based on their genotype and tissue gene expression signature.},

  abstract = {As part of a broader collaborative network of exome sequencing studies, we developed a jointly called data set of 5,685 Ashkenazi Jewish exomes. We make publicly available a resource of site and allele frequencies, which should serve as a reference for medical genetics in the Ashkenazim (hosted in part at https://ibd.broadinstitute.org, also available in gnomAD at http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org). We estimate that 34\% of protein-coding alleles present in the Ashkenazi Jewish population at frequencies greater than 0.2\% are significantly more frequent (mean 15-fold) than their maximum frequency observed in other reference populations. Arising via a well-described founder effect approximately 30 generations ago, this catalog of enriched alleles can contribute to differences in genetic risk and overall prevalence of diseases between populations. As validation we document 148 AJ enriched protein-altering alleles that overlap with "pathogenic" ClinVar alleles (table available at https://github.com/macarthur-lab/clinvar/blob/master/output/clinvar.tsv), including those that account for 10-100 fold differences in prevalence between AJ and non-AJ populations of some rare diseases, especially recessive conditions, including Gaucher disease (GBA, p.Asn409Ser, 8-fold enrichment); Canavan disease (ASPA, p.Glu285Ala, 12-fold enrichment); and Tay-Sachs disease (HEXA, c.1421+1G{$>$}C, 27-fold enrichment; p.Tyr427IlefsTer5, 12-fold enrichment). We next sought to use this catalog, of well-established relevance to Mendelian disease, to explore Crohn's disease, a common disease with an estimated two to four-fold excess prevalence in AJ. We specifically attempt to evaluate whether strong acting rare alleles, particularly protein-truncating or otherwise large effect-size alleles, enriched by the same founder-effect, contribute excess genetic risk to Crohn's disease in AJ, and find that ten rare genetic risk factors in NOD2 and LRRK2 are enriched in AJ (p {$<$} 0.005), including several novel contributing alleles, show evidence of association to CD. Independently, we find that genomewide common variant risk defined by GWAS shows a strong difference between AJ and non-AJ European control population samples (0.97 s.d. higher, p{$<$}10-16). Taken together, the results suggest coordinated selection in AJ population for higher CD risk alleles in general. The results and approach illustrate the value of exome sequencing data in case-control studies along with reference data sets like ExAC (sites VCF available via FTP at ftp.broadinstitute.org/pub/ExAC\_release/release0.3/) to pinpoint genetic variation that contributes to variable disease predisposition across populations.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Avascular necrosis (AVN) is associated with significant morbidity potentially causing severe pain and disability; patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a higher prevalence of AVN compared with non-IBD populations. The purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of AVN in our IBD population and to evaluate these subjects for the presence of clinical characteristics associated with AVN on computed tomography (CT) imaging. METHODS: In 1313 IBD patients with abdomen/pelvis CT scans, we identified 27 patients (2.1\%) with CT findings consistent with AVN. Through historical chart review, we confirmed that most patients had prior exposure to steroids, although 2 patients had no documented steroid exposure at all. RESULTS: We found that 59\% of the concurrent radiology reports did not comment on the presence of AVN, suggesting that incidental CT findings of AVN among IBD patients are likely underreported. Notably, we found that 63\% of these cases had documented complaints of low-back and/or hip pain. Using logistic regression, we found an association between anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive status across IBD (p = 0.007) and a smoking history in Crohn disease (p = 0.03) with the presence of AVN. CONCLUSIONS: We found that a significant proportion of IBD patients with AVN are reported in their records as having hip or low-back pain, and review of CT imaging under dedicated bone windows may identify AVN among this population. Our findings also suggest that additional etiological factors, beyond corticosteroids, contribute to the development of AVN in IBD. Further investigation is warranted regarding the mechanisms associated with AVN in IBD.},

However, the genetic architecture of the trait remains largely unknown. The recent development of machine learning (ML) approaches incited us to apply them to classify healthy  and diseased people according to their genomic information. The Immunochip dataset containing 18,227 CD patients and 34,050 healthy controls enrolled and genotyped by the international Inflammatory Bowel Disease genetic consortium (IIBDGC) has been re-analyzed using a set of ML methods: penalized logistic regression (LR), gradient boosted trees (GBT) and artificial neural networks (NN). The main score used to compare the methods was the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) statistics. The impact of quality control (QC), imputing and coding methods on LR results showed that QC methods and imputation of missing genotypes may artificially increase the scores. At the opposite, neither the patient/control ratio nor marker preselection or coding strategies significantly affected the results. LR methods, including Lasso, Ridge and ElasticNet provided similar results with a maximum AUC of 0.80. GBT methods like XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost, together with dense NN with one or more hidden layers, provided similar AUC values, suggesting limited epistatic effects in the genetic architecture of the trait. ML methods detected near all the genetic variants previously identified by GWAS among the best predictors plus additional predictors with lower effects. The robustness and complementarity of the different methods are also studied. Compared to LR, non-linear models such as GBT or NN may provide robust complementary approaches to identify and classify genetic markers.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rare variants ({$<$}1\%) likely contribute significantly to risk for common diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in specific patient subsets, such as those with high familiality. They are, however, extraordinarily challenging to identify. METHODS: To discover candidate rare variants associated with IBD, we performed whole-exome sequencing on 6 members of a pediatric-onset IBD family with multiple affected individuals. To determine whether the variants discovered in this family are also associated with nonfamilial IBD, we investigated their influence on disease in 2 large case-control (CC) series. RESULTS: We identified 2 rare variants, rs142430606 and rs200958270, both in the established IBD-susceptibility gene IL17REL, carried by all 4 affected family members and their obligate carrier parents. We then demonstrated that both variants are associated with sporadic ulcerative colitis (UC) in 2 independent data sets. For UC in CC 1: rs142430606 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.99, Padj = 0.028; minor allele frequency [MAF]cases = 0.0063, MAFcontrols = 0.0021); rs200958270 (OR = 2.61, Padj = 0.082; MAFcases = 0.0045, MAFcontrols = 0.0017). For UC in CC 2: rs142430606 (OR = 1.94, P = 0.0056; MAFcases = 0.0071, MAFcontrols = 0.0045); rs200958270 (OR = 2.08, P = 0.0028; MAFcases = 0.0071, MAFcontrols = 0.0042). CONCLUSIONS: We discover in a family and replicate in 2 CC data sets 2 rare susceptibility variants for IBD, both in IL17REL. Our results illustrate that whole-exome sequencing performed on disease-enriched families to guide association testing can be an efficient strategy for the discovery of rare disease-associated variants. We speculate that rare variants identified in families and confirmed in the general population may be important modifiers of disease risk for patients with a family history, and that genetic testing of these variants may be warranted in this patient subset.},

  abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic diseases of the digestive tract that affects millions of people worldwide. Genetic, environmental and microbial factors have been implicated in the onset and exacerbation of IBD. However, the mechanisms associating gut microbial dysbioses and aberrant immune responses remain largely unknown. The integrative Human Microbiome Project seeks to close these gaps by examining the dynamics of microbiome functionality in disease by profiling the gut microbiomes of {$>$}100 individuals sampled over a 1-year period. Here, we present the first results based on 78 paired faecal metagenomes~and~metatranscriptomes, and 222 additional metagenomes from 59 patients with Crohn's disease, 34 with ulcerative colitis and 24 non-IBD control patients. We demonstrate several cases in which measures of microbial gene expression in the inflamed gut can be informative relative to metagenomic profiles of functional potential. First, although many microbial organisms exhibited concordant DNA and RNA abundances, we also detected species-specific biases in transcriptional activity, revealing predominant transcription of pathways by individual microorganisms per host (for example, by Faecalibacterium prausnitzii). Thus, a loss of these organisms in disease may have more far-reaching consequences than suggested by their genomic abundances. Furthermore, we identified organisms that were metagenomically abundant but inactive or dormant in the gut with little or no expression (for example, Dialister invisus). Last, certain disease-specific microbial characteristics were more pronounced or only detectable at the transcript level, such as pathways that were predominantly expressed by different organisms in patients with IBD (for example, Bacteroides vulgatus and Alistipes putredinis). This provides potential insights into gut microbial pathway transcription that can vary over time, inducing phenotypical changes that are complementary to those linked to metagenomic abundances. The study's results highlight the strength of analysing both the activity and the presence of gut microorganisms to provide insight into the role of the microbiome in IBD.},

Using whole-genome sequencing, a novel hemizygous defect in NOX1 encoding NAPDH oxidase 1 was identified in a patient with ulcerative colitis-like VEOIBD. Exome screening of 1,878 pediatric patients identified further seven male inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with rare NOX1 mutations. Loss-of-function was validated in p.N122H and p.T497A, and to a lesser degree in p.Y470H, p.R287Q, p.I67M, p.Q293R as well as the previously described p.P330S, and the common NOX1 SNP p.D360N (rs34688635) variant. The missense mutation p.N122H abrogated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in cell lines, ex vivo colonic explants, and patient-derived colonic organoid cultures. Within colonic crypts, NOX1 constitutively generates a high level of ROS in the crypt lumen. Analysis of 9,513 controls and 11,140 IBD patients of non-Jewish European ancestry did not reveal an association between p.D360N and IBD. Our data suggest that loss-of-function variants in NOX1 do not cause a Mendelian disorder of high penetrance but are a context-specific modifier. Our results implicate that variants in NOX1 change brush border ROS within colonic crypts at the interface between the epithelium and luminal microbes.},

Using bacterial fluorescence-activated cell sorting coupled with 16S rRNA gene sequencing (IgA-SEQ), we profiled IgA coating of intestinal microbiota in a large cohort of IBD patients and identified bacteria associated with disease and treatment. Forty-three bacterial taxa displayed significantly higher IgA coating in IBD compared with controls, including 8 taxa exhibiting differential IgA coating but similar relative abundance. Patients treated with anti-TNF-α therapies exhibited dramatically altered microbiota-specific IgA responses compared with controls. Furthermore, increased IgA coating of Oscillospira was associated with a delay in time to surgery. These results demonstrate that investigating IgA responses to microbiota can uncover potential disease-modifying taxa and reveal improved biomarkers of clinical course in IBD.},

  abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex genetic disorder of two major phenotypes, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), with increased risk in Ashkenazi Jews. Twelve genome-wide linkage screens have identified multiple loci, but these screens have been of modest size and have used low-density microsatellite markers. We, therefore, performed a high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genome-wide linkage study of 993 IBD multiply affected pedigrees (25\% Jewish ancestry) that contained 1709 IBD-affected relative pairs, including 919 CD-CD pairs and 312 UC-UC pairs. We identified a significant novel CD locus on chromosome 13p13.3 (peak logarithm of the odds (LOD) score=3.98) in all pedigrees, significant linkage evidence on chromosomes 1p35.1 (peak LOD score=3.5) and 3q29 (peak LOD score=3.19) in Jewish CD pedigrees, and suggestive loci for Jewish IBD on chromosome 10q22 (peak LOD score=2.57) and Jewish UC on chromosome 2q24 (peak LOD score=2.69). Nominal or greater linkage evidence was present for most previously designated IBD loci (IBD1-9), notably, IBD1 for CD families at chromosome 16q12.1 (peak LOD score=4.86) and IBD6 in non-Jewish UC families at chromosome 19p12 (peak LOD score=2.67). This study demonstrates the ability of high information content adequately powered SNP genome-wide linkage studies to identify loci not observed in multiple microsatellite-based studies in smaller cohorts.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Causes of inflammatory bowel diseases are not well understood and the most prominent forms, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are sometimes hard to distinguish. Glycosylation of IgG has been~associated with CD and UC. IgG Fc-glycosylation affects IgG effector functions. We evaluated changes in IgG Fc-glycosylation associated with UC and CD, as well as with disease characteristics in different patient groups. METHODS: We analyzed 3441 plasma samples obtained from 2 independent cohorts of patients with CD (874 patients from Italy and 391 from the United States) or UC (1056 from Italy and 253 from the US and healthy individuals [controls]; 427 in Italy and 440 from the United States). IgG Fc-glycosylation (tryptic glycopeptides) was analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. We analyzed associations between disease status (UC~vs controls, CD vs controls, and UC vs CD) and glycopeptide traits, and associations between clinical characteristics and glycopeptide traits, using a logistic regression model with age and sex included as covariates. RESULTS: Patients with CD or UC had lower levels of IgG galactosylation than controls. For example, the odds ratio (OR) for IgG1 galactosylation in patients with CD was 0.59 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.69) and for patients with UC was 0.81 (95\% CI, 0.71-0.92). Fucosylation of IgG was increased in patients with CD vs controls (for IgG1: OR, 1.27; 95\% CI, 1.12-1.44), but decreased in patients with UC vs controls (for IgG23: OR, 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.63-0.82). Decreased galactosylation associated with more severe CD or UC, including the need for surgery in patients with UC vs controls (for IgG1: OR, 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.54-0.89) and in patients with CD vs controls (for IgG23: OR, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.66-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective analysis of plasma samples from patients with CD or UC, we~associated levels of IgG Fc-glycosylation with disease (compared to controls) and its clinical features. These findings could increase our understanding of mechanisms of CD and UC~pathogenesis and be used to develop diagnostics or guide~treatment.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies as well as murine models have shown that the interleukin 23 receptor (IL23R) pathway plays a pivotal role in chronic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn disease (CD), ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, and type 1 diabetes. Genome-wide association studies and targeted re-sequencing studies have revealed the presence of multiple potentially causal variants of the IL23R. Specifically the G149R, V362I, and R381Q IL23Rα chain variants are linked to protection against the development of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis in humans. Moreover, the exact mechanism of action of these receptor variants has not been elucidated. We show that all three of these IL23Rα variants cause a reduction in IL23 receptor activation-mediated phosphorylation of the signal-transducing activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and phosphorylation of signal transducing activator of transcription 4 (STAT4). The reduction in signaling is due to lower levels of cell surface receptor expression. For G149R, the receptor retention in the endoplasmic reticulum is due to an impairment of receptor maturation, whereas the R381Q and V362I variants have reduced protein stability. Finally, we demonstrate that the endogenous expression of IL23Rα protein from V362I and R381Q variants in human lymphoblastoid cell lines exhibited lower expression levels relative to susceptibility alleles. Our results suggest a convergent cause of IL23Rα variant protection against chronic inflammatory disease.},

  abstract = {Currently, the best clinical predictor for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is family history. Over 163 sequence variants have been associated with IBD in genome-wide association studies, but they have weak effects and explain only a fraction of the observed heritability. It is expected that additional variants contribute to the genomic architecture of IBD, possibly including rare variants with effect sizes larger than the identified common variants. Here we applied a family study design and sequenced 38 individuals from five families, under the hypothesis that families with multiple IBD-affected individuals harbor one or more risk variants that (i) are shared among affected family members, (ii) are rare and (iii) have substantial effect on disease development. Our analysis revealed not only novel candidate risk variants but also high polygenic risk scores for common known risk variants in four out of the five families. Functional analysis of our top novel variant in the remaining family, a rare missense mutation in the ubiquitin ligase TRIM11, suggests that it leads to increased nuclear factor of kappa light chain enhancer in B-cells (NF-kappaB) signaling. We conclude that an accumulation of common weak-effect variants accounts for the high incidence of IBD in most, but not all families we analyzed  and that a family study design can identify novel rare variants conferring risk for IBD with potentially large effect size, such as the TRIM11 p.H414Y mutation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The interleukin (IL)23 pathway contributes to IBD pathogenesis and is being actively studied as a therapeutic target in patients with IBD. Unexpected outcomes in these therapeutic trials have highlighted the importance of understanding the cell types and mechanisms through which IL23 regulates immune outcomes. How IL23 regulates macrophage outcomes and the consequences of the IL23R R381Q IBD-protective variant on macrophages are not well defined; macrophages are key players in IBD pathogenesis and inflammation. DESIGN: We analysed protein and RNA expression, signalling and localisation in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) through western blot, ELISA, real-time PCR, flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation and microscopy. RESULTS: IL23R was critical for optimal levels of pattern-recognition receptor (PRR)-induced signalling and cytokines in human MDMs. In contrast to the coreceptor IL12Rβ1, IL23 induced dynamic IL23R cell surface regulation and this required clathrin and dynamin-mediated endocytosis and endocytic recycling-dependent pathways; these pathways were essential for IL23R-mediated outcomes. The IBD-protective IL23R R381Q variant showed distinct outcomes. Relative to IL23R R381, HeLa cells expressing IL23R Q381 showed decreased IL23R recycling and reduced assembly of IL23R Q381 with Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway members. In MDMs from IL23R Q381 carriers, IL23R accumulated in late endosomes and lysosomes on IL23 treatment and cells demonstrated decreased IL23R- and PRR-induced signalling and cytokines relative to IL23R R381 MDMs. CONCLUSION: Macrophage-mediated inflammatory pathways are key contributors to IBD pathogenesis, and we identify an autocrine/paracrine IL23 requirement in PRR-initiated human macrophage outcomes and in human intestinal myeloid cells, establish that IL23R undergoes ligand-induced recycling, define mechanisms regulating IL23R-induced signalling and determine how the IBD-protective IL23R R381Q variant modulates these processes.},

A numeric rating scale (NRS) is a quick, inexpensive, and convenient patient-reported outcome that can capture the patient's overall perception of health. AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the validity, reliability, and responsiveness of an NRS and evaluate its use in clinical practice in patients with CD and UC. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated patient-reported NRS scores and measured correlations between NRS and a range of severity measures, including physician-reported NRS, Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI), inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients with CD. Subsequently, we evaluated the correlation between the NRS and standard measures of health status (HBI or simple colitis clinical activity index [SCCAI]) and laboratory tests (sedimentation rate [ESR], CRP, and fecal calprotectin) in patients with CD and UC. RESULTS: The patient-reported NRS showed excellent correlation with CDAI (R (2) = 0.59, p {$<$} 0.0001), IBDQ (R (2) = 0.66, p {$<$} 0.0001), and HBI (R (2) = 0.32, p {$<$} 0.0001) in patients with CD. The NRS showed poor, but statistically significant correlation with SCCAI (R (2) = 0.25, p {$<$} 0.0001) in patients with UC. The NRS did not correlate with CRP, ESR, or calprotectin. The NRS was reliable and responsive to change. CONCLUSIONS: The NRS is a valid, reliable, and responsive measure that may be useful to evaluate patients with CD and possibly UC.},

This increase in colitis severity was associated with lamina propria DCs that showed increased Dectin-1-induced NF-κB activation and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Colitis severity was driven by LRRK2 activation of NF-κB pathway components including the TAK1 complex and TRAF6. Next, we found that membrane-associated LRRK2 (in association with TAB2) caused inactivation of Beclin-1 and inhibition of autophagy. HCT116 colon epithelial cells lacking Beclin-1 exhibited increased LRRK2 expression compared to wild-type cells, suggesting that inhibition of autophagy potentially could augment LRRK2 proinflammatory signaling. We then showed that LRRK2 inhibitors decreased Dectin-1-induced TNF-α production by mouse DCs and ameliorated DSS-induced colitis, both in control and Lrrk2 transgenic animals. Finally, we demonstrated that LRRK2 inhibitors blocked TNF-α production by cultured DCs from patients with CD. Our findings suggest that normalization of LRRK2 activation could be a therapeutic approach for treating IBD, regardless of whether a LRRK2 risk allele is involved.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been considerable progress in identifying inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] susceptibility genes but little progress in examining the role of genetic variation in the development of the extra-intestinal manifestations [EIMs] of IBD. This study identified clinical, serological, and genetic factors associated with ocular EIMs [O-EIMs] in IBD. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case-control study of IBD patients, comparing those with and without O-EIMs using the Cedars-Sinai IBD Research Repository and the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium Repository. Genotyping was performed using Illumina whole genome platforms. RESULTS: In all, 124 cases and 3328 controls with available clinical data were identified; 103 cases and 2808 controls had genetic data available. Erythema nodosum and peripheral arthritis particularly were common in patients with O-EIMs [p = 2.77 x 10(-13) and p = 2.58 x 10(-13), respectively] with increasing odds ratios for O-EIMs with each additional non-ocular-EIM [for ≥ 2 EIMs, odds ratio 14.72]. Nominal association with O-EIMs was observed at several known IBD susceptibility single nuclear polymorphisms. One locus, containing RBM19, achieved genome-wide level of significance for association with O-EIMs. CONCLUSIONS: In IBD, O-EIMs co-occur with musculoskeletal and skin manifestations and, in this study, are nominally associated with known IBD loci. Additional cohorts are needed to verify these results and identify additional genes.},

Human studies show that some KRT8 variants predispose to end-stage liver disease and progression and suggest that such variants might associate with UC or CD. We asked whether mutations in KRT8 or KRT19, the major intestinal keratins, are associated with UC/CD. METHODS: Exonic  regions of the KRT8/KRT19 genes were polymerase chain reaction-amplified using genomic DNA from 2 independent groups. Group I included 91 unrelated patients with CD, 93 unrelated patients with UC, and 70 unrelated/unaffected volunteers. KRT8 variants were also tested with pyrosequencing in Group II that included 682  independent nuclear families with both parents and at least 1 CD/UC-affected offspring and 273 unaffected controls. Both cohorts were enriched for familial IBD. RESULTS: In Group I, KRT19 variants were identified in CD/UC patients within the promoter and exons 1+2, with similar mutation frequencies in the control/CD/UC groups. In contrast, 16 of 184 CD+UC patients harbored KRT8 heterozygous variants involving Gly62-to-Cys and Arg341-to-His and a novel Arg341-to-Cys, which were noted in 4 volunteers (Arg341-to-His) and correlated with extensive UC (P = .005). One family with unaffected parents had 3 pediatric-affected siblings with severe disease, 2 of whom are compound heterozygous (Gly62-to-Cys/Arg341-to-His). However, there was no significant departure from random transmission of the 3 alleles in Group II IBD families. CONCLUSIONS: KRT8 and KRT19 variants are not overtransmitted or associated with familial IBD, although a potential role in sporadic IBD cannot be excluded. A novel but rare keratin-8 Arg341-to-Cys is identified in IBD patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The IL-23 pathway plays a pivotal role in the development of chronic mucosal inflammation seen in the inflammatory bowel diseases. Multiple studies have now established the contribution of the interleukin 23 receptor gene (IL23R) to Crohn's disease (CD) risk in general and of the IL23R R381Q variant in particular. The aim of this work was to estimate the total contribution of this gene to CD risk test using a haplotype approach. METHODS: In all, 763 CD subjects and 254 controls were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms in the IL23R gene using Illumina and ABI methods. Haplotypes were assigned using PHASEv2 and tested for association with CD by chi-square and permutation. RESULTS: Haplotypes with both increased and decreased risk for CD were observed in 2 of the 4 observed blocks (Block 2 H1: 55.4\% control, 64\% CD, P = 0.019; H2: 64.5\% control, 54.4\% CD, P = 0.006; Block 3 H1: 55.8\% control, 64.4\% CD, P = 0.013; H2: 47.0\% control, 36.6\% CD, P = 0.001). The population attributable risk for these haplotypes was substantially larger than that estimated for the IL23R R381Q variant (Block 2 H1 and block 3 H1 approximately 20\%, compared with approximately 4\% for Block 3 H6, containing the variant). CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that IL23R makes a substantial contribution to CD susceptibility, larger than that estimated from the population frequency of the R381Q variant. These observations also support the expectation that finding "hits" from genomewide association studies will be but an important chapter in the story of unraveling the genetic contribution to CD, rather than the final chapter that brings clarity to all the plot twists of a complicated story.},

TL1A mediates a strong costimulation of these TH subsets, particularly of mucosal CCR9+ T cells. However, the signaling pathways that TL1A induces in different TH subsets are incompletely understood. We investigated the function of TL1A on human TH17 cells. TL1A, together with TGF-β, IL-6, and IL-23, enhanced the secretion of IL-17 and IFN-γ from human CD4+ memory T cells. TL1A induced expression of the transcription factors BATF and T-bet that correlated with the secretion of IL-17 and IFN-γ. In contrast, TL1A alone induced high levels of IL-22 in memory CD4+ T cells and committed TH17 cells. However, TL1A did not enhance expression of IL-17A in TH17 cells. Expression of the transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which regulates the expression of IL-22 was not affected by TL1A. Transcriptome analysis of TH17 cells revealed increased expression of IL-9 in response to TL1A. Blocking IL-9 receptor antibodies abrogated TL1A-induced IL-22 secretion. Furthermore, TL1A increased IL-9 production by peripheral TH17 cells isolated from patients with Crohn's disease. These data suggest that TL1A differentially induces expression of TH17 effector cytokines IL-17, -9, and -22 and provides a potential target for therapeutic intervention in TH17-driven chronic inflammatory diseases.},

  abstract = {Abnormalities of the intestinal microbiota are implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), two spectra of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the high complexity and low inter-individual overlap of intestinal microbial composition are formidable barriers to identifying microbial taxa representing this dysbiosis. These difficulties might be overcome by an ecologic analytic strategy to identify modules of interacting bacteria (rather than individual bacteria) as quantitative reproducible features of microbial composition in normal and IBD mucosa. We sequenced 16S ribosomal RNA genes from 179 endoscopic lavage samples from different intestinal regions in 64 subjects (32 controls, 16 CD and 16 UC patients in clinical remission). CD and UC patients showed a reduction in phylogenetic diversity and shifts in microbial composition, comparable to previous studies using conventional mucosal biopsies. Analysis of weighted co-occurrence network revealed 5 microbial modules. These modules were unprecedented, as they were detectable in all individuals, and their composition and abundance was recapitulated in an independent, biopsy-based mucosal dataset 2 modules were associated with healthy, CD, or UC disease states. Imputed metagenome analysis indicated that these modules displayed distinct metabolic functionality, specifically the enrichment of oxidative response and glycan metabolism pathways relevant to host-pathogen interaction in the disease-associated modules. The highly preserved microbial modules accurately classified IBD status of individual patients during disease quiescence, suggesting that microbial dysbiosis in IBD may be an underlying disorder independent of disease activity. Microbial modules thus provide an integrative view of microbial ecology relevant to IBD.},

The H antigen is an oligosaccharide moiety that acts as both an attachment site and carbon source for intestinal bacteria. Non-secretors, who are homozygous for the loss-of-function alleles of FUT2 gene (sese), have increased susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD). To characterize the effect of FUT2 polymorphism on the mucosal ecosystem, we profiled the microbiome, meta-proteome and meta-metabolome of 75 endoscopic lavage samples from the cecum and sigmoid of 39 healthy subjects (12 SeSe, 18 Sese and 9 sese). Imputed metagenomic analysis revealed perturbations of energy metabolism in the microbiome of non-secretor and heterozygote individuals, notably the enrichment of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, cofactor and vitamin metabolism and glycan biosynthesis and metabolism-related pathways, and the depletion of amino-acid biosynthesis and metabolism. Similar changes were observed in mice bearing the FUT2(-/-) genotype. Metabolomic analysis of human specimens revealed concordant as well as novel changes in the levels of several metabolites. Human metaproteomic analysis indicated that these functional changes were accompanied by sub-clinical levels of inflammation in the local intestinal mucosa. Therefore, the colonic microbiota of non-secretors is altered at both the compositional and functional levels, affecting the host mucosal state and potentially explaining the association of FUT2 genotype and CD susceptibility.},

In this study, we have analyzed the microbiome of a large cohort of individuals recruited at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, Canada. Biopsies were taken from subjects with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and HC, and also individuals having undergone ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for treatment of ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis. Microbial 16S rRNA was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. We observed a great deal of variability in the microbiome characterizing different sampling locations. Samples from pouch and afferent limb were comparable in microbial composition. When comparing sigmoid and terminal ileum samples, more differences were observed. The greatest number of differentially abundant microbes was observed when comparing either pouch or afferent limb samples to sigmoid or terminal ileum. Despite these differences, we were able to observe modest microbial variability between inflammatory bowel disease phenotypes and HCs, even when controlling for sampling location and additional experimental factors. Most detected associations were observed between HCs and Crohn's disease, with decreases in specific genera in the families Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae characterizing tissue samples from individuals with Crohn's disease. This study highlights important considerations when analyzing the composition of the microbiome and also provides useful insight into differences in the microbiome characterizing these seemingly related phenotypes.},

It has been a challenge to link the effects of particular loci to phenotypes of cells associated with pathogenesis of CD, such as Paneth cells. We investigated whether specific phenotypes of Paneth cells associated with particular genetic susceptibility loci can be used to define specific subtypes of CD. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 119 resection specimens collected from patients with CD at 2 separate medical centers. Paneth cell phenotypes were classified as normal or abnormal (with disordered, diminished, diffuse, or excluded granule phenotypes) based on lysozyme-positive secretory granule morphology. To uncover the molecular basis of the Paneth cell phenotypes, we developed methods to determine transcriptional profiles from whole-thickness and laser-capture microdissected, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. RESULTS: The proportion of abnormal Paneth cells was associated with the number of CD-associated NOD2 risk alleles. The cumulative number of NOD2 and ATG16L1 risk alleles had an additive effect on the proportion of abnormal Paneth cells. Unsupervised clustering analysis of demographic and Paneth cell data divided patients into 2 principal subgroups, defined by high and low proportions of abnormal Paneth cells. The disordered and diffuse abnormal Paneth cell phenotypes were associated with an altered transcriptional signature of immune system activation. We observed an inverse correlation between abnormal Paneth cells and presence of granuloma. In addition, high proportions of abnormal Paneth cells were associated with shorter time to disease recurrence after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Histologic analysis of Paneth cell phenotypes can be used to divide patients with CD into subgroups with distinct pathognomonic and clinical features.},

The NLRP3 region was recently reported to be associated with Crohn's disease (CD) susceptibility. We therefore sought to evaluate MEFV as an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) susceptibility gene. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: MEFV colonic mucosal gene expression was significantly increased in experimental colitis mice models (TNBS p{$<$}0.0003; DSS p{$<$}0.006), in biopsies from CD (p{$<$}0.02) and severe ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (p{$<$}0.008). Comprehensive genetic screening of the MEFV region in the Belgian exploratory sample set (440 CD trios, 137 UC trios, 239 CD cases, 96 UC cases, and 107 healthy controls) identified SNPs located in the MEFV 5' haplotype block that were significantly associated with UC (rs224217; p = 0.003; A allele frequency: 56\% cases, 45\% controls), while no CD associations were observed. Sequencing and subsequent genotyping of variants located in this associated haplotype block identified three synonymous variants (D102D/rs224225, G138G/rs224224, A165A/rs224223) and one non-synonymous variant (R202Q/rs224222) located in MEFV exon 2 that were significantly associated with UC (rs224222: p = 0.0005; A allele frequency: 32\% in cases, 23\% in controls). No consistent associations were observed in additional Canadian (256 CD trios, 91 UC trios) and Scottish (495 UC, 370 controls) sample sets. We note that rs224222 showed marginal association (p = 0.012; G allele frequency: 82\% in cases, 70\% in controls) in the Canadian sample, but with a different risk allele. None of the NLRP3 common variants were associated with UC in the Belgian-Canadian UC samples and no significant interactions were observed between NLRP3 and MEFV that could explain the observed flip-flop of the rs224222 risk allele. CONCLUSION: The differences in association levels observed between the sample sets may be a consequence of distinct founder effects or of the relative small sample size of the cohorts evaluated in this study. However, the results suggest that common variants in the MEFV region do not contribute to CD and UC susceptibility.},

  abstract = {Droplet-based single cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, largely represented by the 10×~Genomics Chromium system, is able to measure the gene expression from tens of thousands of single cells simultaneously. More recently, coupled with the cutting-edge Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq), the droplet-based system has allowed for immunophenotyping of single cells based on cell surface expression of specific proteins together with simultaneous transcriptome profiling in the same cell. Despite the rapid advances in technologies, novel statistical methods and computational tools for analyzing multi-modal CITE-Seq data are lacking. In this study, we developed BREM-SC, a novel Bayesian Random Effects Mixture model that jointly clusters paired single cell transcriptomic and proteomic data. Through simulation studies and analysis of public and in-house real data sets, we successfully demonstrated the validity and advantages of this method in fully utilizing both types of data to accurately identify cell clusters. In addition, as a probabilistic model-based approach, BREM-SC is able to quantify the clustering uncertainty for each single cell. This new method will greatly facilitate researchers to jointly study transcriptome and surface proteins at the single cell level to make new biological discoveries, particularly in the area of immunology.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: African Americans (AAs) are an admixed population of West African (WA) and European ancestry (EA). Crohn's disease (CD) susceptibility genes have not been established. We therefore evaluated the contribution of European admixture and major established risk genes to AA CD. METHODS: Ninety-seven admixture informative markers were genotyped for ancestry estimates using STRUCTURE. Overall, 354 AA CD cases and 354 ethnicity-matched controls were genotyped for total 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ATG16L1, NOD2, IBD5, IL23R and IRGM by TaqMan or direct sequencing. Association was evaluated by logistic regression, adjusted for ancestry. RESULTS: Mean EA was similar among the CD cases and controls (20.9\% and 20.4\%, respectively, P = 0.58). No significant admixture differences were observed among 211 to 227 cases stratified by phenotypic subclassifications including onset, surgery, site, and behavior. CD was associated with NOD2 carrier (6.93\% CD, 2.15\% Controls, P = 0.007), ATG16L1 Thr300Ala (36.1\% CD, 29.3\% Controls, P = 0.003), SLC22A4 and SLC22A5 (IBD5 locus) functional SNPs (Leu503Phe [10.5\% CD, 7.6\% Controls, P = 0.05] and g-207c [41.3\% CD, 35.7\% Controls, P = 0.03], respectively), and IL23R rs2201841 (18.2\% CD, 13.8\% Controls, P = 0.03), but not IRGM variants, nor three African ancestral NOD2 nonsynonymous variants. IBD5 risk was recessive. An all-minor allele IBD5 haplotype from EA was associated (P = 0.05), whereas a more common haplotype isolating g-207c was not. CONCLUSIONS: Specific functional gene variations contribute significantly to AA CD risk. Established NOD2, SLC22A4-A5, and ATG16L1 variants show increased CD risk, with IBD5 recessive. Although CD is more common in whites, European admixture is similar among AA cases and controls.},

The relevance of genetic variants to disease pathogenesis is still uncertain because of not characterized gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. We examined the predictive value of combining the 133 UC risk loci  with genetic interactions in an ongoing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) GWAS. The Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) IBD GWAS was used as a replication cohort. We applied logic regression (LR), a novel adaptive regression methodology, to search for high-order interactions. Exploratory genotype correlations with UC sub-phenotypes [extent of disease, need of surgery, age of onset, extra-intestinal manifestations and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)]  were conducted. The combination of 133 UC loci yielded good UC risk predictability [area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86]. A higher cumulative allele score predicted higher UC risk. Through LR, several lines of evidence for genetic interactions were identified and successfully replicated in the WTCCC cohort. The genetic interactions combined with the gene-smoking interaction significantly improved predictability in the model (AUC, from 0.86 to 0.89, P = 3.26E-05). Explained UC variance increased from 37 to 42 \% after adding the interaction terms. A within case analysis found suggested genetic association with PSC. Our study demonstrates that the LR methodology allows the identification and replication of high-order genetic interactions in UC GWAS datasets. UC risk can be predicted by a 133 loci and improved by adding gene-gene and gene-environment  interactions.},

The value of genetic variants in clinical practice is not defined because of limited explained heritability. METHODS: We examined model predictability of combining the 71 CD risk alleles and genetic interactions in an ongoing inflammatory bowel disease genome-wide association study. The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium inflammatory bowel disease genome-wide association  study was used as a replicate cohort. We used logic regression, an adaptive regression methodology, to search for high-order binary predictors (e.g., single-nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] interactions). RESULTS: The combined 71 CD SNPs had good CD risk predictability (area under the curve of 0.75 and 0.73 in the 2 cohorts). Higher cumulative allele score predicted higher CD risk, but a relatively small difference in cumulative allele scores was observed between CD and controls (49 versus 47, P {$<$} 0.001). Through LR, we identified high-order genetic interactions and significantly improved the model predictability (area under the curve, from 0.75 to 0.77, P {$<$} 0.0001). A genetic interaction model, including NOD2, ATG16L1, IL10/IL19, C13orf31, and chr21q loci, was discovered and successfully replicated in the independent Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium cohort. The explained heritability of the 71 CD SNPs alone was 24\% and increased  to 27\% after adding the genetic interactions. CONCLUSIONS: A novel approach allowed the identification and replication of genetic interactions among NOD2, ATG16L1, IL10/IL19, C13orf31, and chr21q loci.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Approximately 80\% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have intermittently active disease and up to 20\% will require a colectomy, but little data available on predictors of poor disease course. The aim of this study was to identify clinical and genetic markers that can predict prognosis. METHODS: Medical records of patients with UC with ≥5 years of follow-up and available DNA and serum were retrospectively assessed. Immunochip was used to genotype loci associated with immune mediated inflammatory disorders (IMIDs), inflammatory bowel diseases, and other single nucleotide polypmorphisms previously associated with disease severity. Serum levels of pANCA, ASCA, CBir1, and OmpC were also evaluated. Requirement for colectomy, medication, and hospitalization were used to group patients into 3 prognostic groups. RESULTS: Six hundred one patients with UC were classified as mild (n = 78), moderate (n = 273), or severe disease (n = 250). Proximal disease location frequencies at diagnosis were 13\%, 21\%, and 30\% for mild, moderate, and severe UC, respectively (P = 0.001). Disease severity was associated with greater proximal extension rates on follow-up (P {$<$} 0.0001) and with shorter time to extension (P = 0.03) and to prednisone initiation (P = 0.0004). When comparing severe UC with mild and moderate UC together, diagnosis age {$>$}40 and proximal disease location were associated with severe UC (odds ratios = 1.94 and 2.12, respectively). None of the single nucleotide polypmorphisms or serum markers tested was associated with severe UC, proximal disease extension or colectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Older age and proximal disease location at diagnosis, but not genetic and serum markers, were associated with a more severe course. Further work is required to identify biomarkers that will predict outcomes in UC.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The clinical presentation and course of Crohn's disease (CD) is highly variable. We sought to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that guide this heterogeneity, and characterise the cellular processes associated with disease phenotypes. DESIGN: We examined both gene expression and gene regulation (chromatin accessibility) in non-inflamed colon tissue from a cohort of adult patients with CD and control patients. To support the generality of our findings, we analysed previously published expression data from a large cohort of treatment-naïve paediatric CD and control ileum. RESULTS: We found that adult patients with CD clearly segregated into two classes based on colon tissue gene expression-one that largely resembled the normal colon and one where certain genes showed expression patterns normally specific to the ileum. These classes were supported by changes in gene regulatory profiles observed at the level of chromatin accessibility, reflective of a fundamental shift in underlying molecular phenotypes. Furthermore, gene expression from the ilea of a treatment-naïve cohort of paediatric patients with CD could be similarly subdivided into colon-like and ileum-like classes. Finally, expression patterns within these CD subclasses highlight large-scale differences in the immune response and aspects of cellular metabolism, and were associated with multiple clinical phenotypes describing disease behaviour, including rectal disease and need for colectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly suggest that these molecular signatures define two clinically relevant forms of CD irrespective of tissue sampling location, patient age or treatment status.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) and erythema nodosum (EN) are the most common cutaneous manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but little is known regarding their etiopathogenesis. METHODS: We performed a case-control study comparing characteristics between IBD patients with a documented episode of PG (PG+) and/or EN (EN+) with those without PG (PG-) and EN (EN-). Data on clinical features were obtained by chart review. IBD-related serology was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and genome-wide data generated using Illumina technology. Standard statistical tests for association were used. RESULTS: We identified a total of 92 cases of PG and 103 cases of EN with genetic and clinical characteristics, of which 64 PG and 55 EN cases were available for serological analyses. Fewer male subjects were identified in the PG(+) (odds ratio 0.6, P = 0.009) and EN(+) groups (odds ratio 0.31, P = 0 {$<$} 0.0001). Colonic disease, previous IBD-related surgery, and noncutaneous extra-intestinal manifestations were more common among both PG(+) and EN(+) patients compared with controls. PG(+) was associated with anti-nuclear cytoplasmic antibody seropositivity (P = 0.03) and higher anti-nuclear cytoplasmic antibody level (P = 0.02) in Crohn's disease. Genetic associations with PG included known IBD loci (IL8RA [P = 0.00003] and PRDM1 [0.03]) as well as with USP15 (4.8 × 10) and TIMP3 (5.6 ×10). Genetic associations with EN included known IBD susceptibility genes (PTGER4 [P = 8.8 × 10], ITGAL [0.03]) as well as SOCS5 (9.64 × 10), CD207 (3.14 × 10), ITGB3 (7.56 × 10), and rs6828740 (4q26) (P {$<$} 5.0 × 10). Multivariable models using clinical, serologic, and genetic parameters predicted PG (area under the curve = 0.8) and EN (area under the curve = 0.97). CONCLUSION: Cutaneous manifestations in IBD are associated with distinctive genetic characteristics and with the similar clinical characteristics, including the development of other extra-intestinal manifestations suggesting shared and distinct etiologies.},

As many functions of cathelicidin are mediated through formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1), we hypothesize that CSA13 mediates anti-fibrogenic effects via FPRL1. Human intestinal biopsies were used in clinical data analysis. Chronic trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis-associated intestinal fibrosis mouse model with the administration of CSA13 was used. Colonic FPRL1 mRNA expression was positively correlated with the histology scores of inflammatory bowel disease patients. In CD patients, colonic FPRL1 mRNA was positively correlated with intestinal stricture. CSA13 administration ameliorated intestinal fibrosis without influencing intestinal microbiota. Inhibition of FPRL1, but not suppression of intestinal microbiota, reversed these protective effects of CSA13. Metabolomic analysis indicated increased fecal mevalonate levels in the TNBS-treated mice, which were reduced by the CSA13 administration. CSA13 inhibited colonic HMG-CoA reductase activity in an FPRL1-dependent manner. Mevalonate reversed the anti-fibrogenic effect of CSA13. The increased colonic FPRL1 expression is associated with severe mucosal disease activity and intestinal stricture. CSA13 inhibits intestinal fibrosis via FPRL1-dependent modulation of HMG-CoA reductase pathway.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: The role of tobacco smoke in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unclear. We investigated interactions between genes and smoking (gene-smoking interactions) that affect risk for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in a case-only study of patients and in mouse models of IBD. METHODS: We used 55 Immunochip-wide datasets that included 19,735 IBD cases (10,856 CD cases and 8879 UC cases) of known smoking status. We performed 3 meta-analyses each for CD, UC, and IBD (CD and UC combined), comparing data for never vs ever smokers, never vs current smokers, and never vs former smokers. We studied the effects of exposure to cigarette smoke in Il10-/- and Nod2-/- mice, as well as in Balb/c mice without disruption of these genes (wild-type mice). Mice were exposed to the smoke of 5 cigarettes per day, 5 days a week, for 8 weeks, in a ventilated smoking chamber, or ambient air (controls). Intestines were collected and analyzed histologically and by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We identified 64 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for which the association between the SNP and IBD were modified by smoking behavior (meta-analysis Wald test P {$<$} 5.0~× 10-5; heterogeneity Cochrane Q test P {$>$} .05). Twenty of these variants were located within the HLA region at 6p21. Analysis of classical HLA alleles (imputed from SNP genotypes) revealed an interaction with smoking. We replicated the interaction of a variant in NOD2 with current smoking in relation to the risk for CD (frameshift variant fs1007insC; rs5743293). We identified 2 variants in the same genomic region (rs2270368 and rs17221417) that interact with smoking in relation to CD risk. Approximately 45\% of the SNPs that interact with smoking were in close vicinity (≤1 Mb) to SNPs previously associated with IBD; many were located near or within genes that regulate mucosal barrier function and immune tolerance. Smoking modified the disease risk of some variants in opposite directions for CD vs UC. Exposure of Interleukin 10 (il10)-deficient mice to cigarette smoke accelerated development of colitis and increased expression of interferon gamma in the small intestine compared to wild-type mice exposed to smoke. NOD2-deficient mice exposed to cigarette smoke developed ileitis, characterized by increased expression of interferon gamma, compared to wild-type mice exposed to smoke. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of 55 Immunochip-wide datasets, we identified 64 SNPs whose association with risk for IBD is modified by tobacco smoking. Gene-smoking interactions were confirmed in mice with disruption of Il10 and Nod2-variants of these genes have been associated with risk for IBD. Our findings from mice and humans revealed that the effects of smoking on risk for IBD depend on genetic variants.},

  abstract = {Thiopurine therapy, commonly used in autoimmune conditions, can be complicated by life-threatening leukopenia. This leukopenia is associated with genetic variation in TPMT (encoding thiopurine S-methyltransferase). Despite a lower frequency of TPMT mutations in Asians, the incidence of thiopurine-induced leukopenia is higher in Asians than in individuals of European descent. Here we performed an Immunochip-based 2-stage association study in 978 Korean subjects with Crohn's disease treated with thiopurines. We identified a nonsynonymous SNP in NUDT15 (encoding p.Arg139Cys) that was strongly associated with thiopurine-induced early leukopenia (odds ratio (OR) = 35.6; P(combined) = 4.88 × 10(-94)). In Koreans, this variant demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 89.4\% and 93.2\%, respectively, for thiopurine-induced early leukopenia (in comparison to 12.1\% and 97.6\% for TPMT variants). Although rare, this SNP was also strongly associated with thiopurine-induced leukopenia in subjects with inflammatory bowel disease of European descent (OR = 9.50; P = 4.64 × 10(-4)). Thus, NUDT15 is a pharmacogenetic determinant for thiopurine-induced leukopenia in diverse populations.},

Beyond the limitations of linkage analysis, multiple genome-wide association studies, their meta-analyses, and targeted genotyping array techniques have broadened our understanding of the genetic architecture of IBD. Currently, over 200 single nucleotide polymorphisms are known to be associated with susceptibility to IBD and through functional analysis of genes and loci, a substantial proportion of pathophysiologic mechanisms have been revealed. However, because only a modest fraction of predicted heritability can be explained by known genes/loci, additional strategies are needed including the identification of rare variants with large effect sizes to help explain the missing heritability. Considerable progress is also being made on applying outcomes of genetic research in diagnostics, classification, prognostics, and the development of new therapeutics of IBD.},

  abstract = {Background Although anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents are effective in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), many patients either do not respond to anti-TNF treatment or lose response over time. The aim of this study was to determine factors associated with response to anti-TNF therapy in IBD. Methods Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis who had consented to participate in a genetics registry and been treated with anti-TNF agents were evaluated retrospectively and categorized as primary nonresponders or secondary nonresponders. We evaluated clinical, serological, and genetic characteristics associated with primary nonresponse or time to loss of response to anti-TNF agents. Results We included 314 CD (51 [16.2\%] primary nonresponders and 179 [57.0\%] secondary nonresponders) and 145 subjects with ulcerative colitis (43 [29.7\%] primary nonresponders and 74 [51.0\%] secondary nonresponders). Colonic involvement (P = 0.017; odds ratio = 8.0) and anti-TNF monotherapy (P = 0.017; odds ratio = 4.9) were associated in a multivariate analysis with primary nonresponse to anti-TNF agents in CD. In addition, higher anti–nuclear cytoplasmic antibody levels (P = 0.019; hazard ratio = 1.01) in CD, anti–nuclear cytoplasmic antibody positivity (P = 0.038; hazard ratio = 1.6) in ulcerative colitis, and a positive family history of IBD (P = 0.044; hazard ratio = 1.3) in all patients with IBD were associated with time to loss of response to anti-TNF agents. Furthermore, various known IBD susceptibility single-nucleotide polymorphisms and additional variants in immune-mediated genes were shown to be associated with primary nonresponse or time to loss of response. Conclusions Our results may help to optimize the use of anti-TNF agents in clinical practice and position these therapies appropriately as clinicians strive for a more personalized approach to managing IBD.},

  abstract = {Intact ATG16L1 plays an essential role in Paneth cell function and intestinal homeostasis. However, the functional consequences of ATG16L1 deficiency in myeloid cells, particularly macrophages, are not fully characterized. We generated mice with Atg16l1 deficiency in myeloid and dendritic cells and showed that mice with myeloid Atg16l1 deficiency had exacerbated colitis in two acute and one chronic model of colitis with increased proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory macrophage ratios, production of proinflammatory cytokines, and numbers of IgA-coated intestinal microbes. Mechanistic analyses using primary murine macrophages showed that Atg16l1 deficiency led to increased reactive oxygen species production, impaired mitophagy, reduced microbial killing, impaired processing of MHC class II Ags, and altered intracellular trafficking to the lysosomal compartments. Increased production of reactive oxygen species and reduced microbial killing may be general features of the myeloid compartment, as they were also observed in Atg16l1-deficient primary murine neutrophils. A missense polymorphism (Thr300Ala) in the essential autophagy gene ATG16L1 is associated with Crohn disease (CD). Previous studies showed that this polymorphism leads to enhanced cleavage of ATG16L1 T300A protein and thus reduced autophagy. Similar findings were shown in primary human macrophages from controls and a population of CD patients carrying the Atg16l1 T300A risk variant and who were controlled for NOD2 CD-associated variants. This study revealed that ATG16L1 deficiency led to alterations in macrophage function that contribute to the severity of CD.},

  abstract = {Summary: level data of GWAS becomes increasingly important in post-GWAS data mining. Here, we present GIGSEA (Genotype Imputed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis), a novel method that uses GWAS summary statistics and eQTL to infer differential gene expression and interrogate gene set enrichment for the trait-associated SNPs. By incorporating empirical eQTL of the disease relevant tissue, GIGSEA naturally accounts for factors such as gene size, gene boundary, SNP distal regulation and multiple-marker regulation. The weighted linear regression model was used to perform the enrichment test, properly adjusting for imputation accuracy, model incompleteness and redundancy in different gene sets. The significance level of enrichment is assessed by the permutation test, where matrix operation was employed to dramatically improve computation speed. GIGSEA has appropriate type I error rates, and discovers the plausible biological findings on the real data set. Availability and implementation: GIGSEA is implemented in R, and freely available at www.github.com/zhushijia/GIGSEA. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
