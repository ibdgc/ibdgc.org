abstract: Although the general association of the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
  5 region on chromosome 5q31 to Crohn's disease (CD) has been replicated repeatedly,
  the identity of the precise causal variant within the region remains unknown. A
  recent report proposed polymorphisms in solute carrier family 22, member 4 (SLC22A4)
  organic cation transporter 1(OCTN1) and solute carrier family 22, member 5 (SLC22A5)
  (OCTN2) as responsible for the IBD5 association, but definitive, large-sample comparison
  of those polymorphisms with others known to be in strong linkage disequilibrium
  was not performed. We evaluated 1879 affected offspring and parents ascertained
  by a North American IBD Genetics Consortium for six IBD5 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms
  (SNPs) to evaluate association localization and ethnic and subphenotypic specificity.
  We confirm association to  the IBD5 region (best SNP IGR2096a_1/rs12521868, Ptextless0.0005)
  and show this association to be exclusive to the non-Jewish (NJ) population (P=0.00005)
  (risk allele undertransmitted in Ashkenazi Jews). Using Phase II HapMap data, we
  demonstrate that there are a set of polymorphisms, spanning genes from prolyl
