abstract: The inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are
  common, chronic disorders that cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal
  bleeding. To identify genetic factors that might contribute to these disorders,
  we performed a genome-wide association study. We found a highly  significant association
  between Crohn's disease and the IL23R gene on chromosome  1p31, which encodes a
  subunit of the receptor for the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-23. An uncommon
  coding variant (rs11209026, c.1142GtextgreaterA, p.Arg381Gln) confers strong protection
  against Crohn's disease, and additional noncoding IL23R variants are independently
  associated. Replication studies confirmed IL23R associations in independent cohorts
  of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. These results and previous
  studies on the proinflammatory role of IL-23 prioritize this signaling pathway as
  a therapeutic target in inflammatory bowel disease.
