abstract: 'BACKGROUND: A subset of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have a benign
  course and an overall favorable prognosis. Early identification of these low-risk
  patients may allow for a less aggressive therapeutic approach and possible reduction
  of therapy-associated risks. The aim of this project was to identify the genetic
  predictors of benign UC phenotype. METHODS: UC patients were selected from the National
  Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Inflammatory Bowel Disease
  Genetics Consortium. Benign phenotype was defined as no need for immunomodulatory
  or biological therapy, hospitalizations, or colectomy. The association between benign
  UC phenotype and known loci linked to the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
  was evaluated. The results for 156 index single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
  from the known IBD loci were extracted for the main analysis. The association of
  the benign phenotype to a genetic burden score was also evaluated. RESULTS: None
  of the index SNPs from the IBD loci reached the predefined threshold of 1 × 10.
  In the exploratory analysis of the remaining Immunochip SNPs and imputed major histocompatibility
  complex data, 5 distinct suggestive association signals are identified (rs1697950,
  rs2523639, rs17836409, rs11742854, and rs75001121). CONCLUSIONS: No SNPs from IBD
  susceptibility loci were found to be associated (at our predefined threshold of
  1 × 10) with a benign UC disease course. The rs11742570 variant on chromosome 5
  was the one with the greatest association to benign disease although the association
  did not reach the predefined significant threshold. Given the modest power of our
  study, the findings suggested on the exploratory analysis merit extension to larger
  discovery cohorts.'
