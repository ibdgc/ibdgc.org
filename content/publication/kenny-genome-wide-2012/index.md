abstract: Crohn's disease (CD) is a complex disorder resulting from the interaction
  of intestinal microbiota with the host immune system in genetically susceptible
  individuals. The largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association to date identified
  71 CD-susceptibility loci in individuals of European ancestry. An important epidemiological
  feature of CD is that it is 2-4 times more prevalent among individuals of Ashkenazi
  Jewish (AJ) descent compared to non-Jewish Europeans (NJ). To explore genetic variation
  associated with CD in AJs, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) by
  combining raw genotype data across 10 AJ cohorts consisting of 907 cases and 2,345
  controls in the discovery stage, followed up by a replication study in 971 cases
  and 2,124 controls. We confirmed genome-wide significant associations of 9 known
  CD loci in AJs and replicated 3 additional loci with strong signal (ptextless5×10⁻⁶).
  Novel signals detected among AJs were mapped to chromosomes 5q21.1 (rs7705924, combined
  p = 2×10⁻⁸; combined odds ratio OR = 1.48), 2p15 (rs6545946, p = 7×10⁻⁹; OR = 1.16),
  8q21.11 (rs12677663, p = 2×10⁻⁸; OR = 1.15), 10q26.3 (rs10734105, p = 3×10⁻⁸; OR = 1.27),
  and 11q12.1 (rs11229030, p = 8×10⁻⁹; OR = 1.15), implicating biologically plausible
  candidate genes, including RPL7, CPAMD8, PRG2, and PRG3. In all, the 16 replicated
  and newly discovered loci, in addition to the three coding NOD2 variants, accounted
  for 11.2% of the total genetic variance for CD risk in the AJ population. This study
  demonstrates the complementary value of genetic studies in the Ashkenazim.
