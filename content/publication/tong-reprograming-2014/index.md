abstract: Fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) is an enzyme that is responsible for the synthesis
  of the H antigen in body fluids and on the intestinal mucosa. The H antigen is an
  oligosaccharide moiety that acts as both an attachment site and carbon source for
  intestinal bacteria. Non-secretors, who are homozygous for the loss-of-function
  alleles of FUT2 gene (sese), have increased susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD).
  To characterize the effect of FUT2 polymorphism on the mucosal ecosystem, we profiled
  the microbiome, meta-proteome and meta-metabolome of 75 endoscopic lavage samples
  from the cecum and sigmoid of 39 healthy subjects (12 SeSe, 18 Sese and 9 sese).
  Imputed metagenomic analysis revealed perturbations of energy metabolism in the
  microbiome of non-secretor and heterozygote individuals, notably the enrichment
  of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, cofactor and vitamin metabolism and glycan
  biosynthesis and metabolism-related pathways, and the depletion of amino-acid biosynthesis
  and metabolism. Similar changes were observed in mice bearing the FUT2(-/-) genotype.
  Metabolomic analysis of human specimens revealed concordant as well as novel changes
  in the levels of several metabolites. Human metaproteomic analysis indicated that
  these functional changes were accompanied by sub-clinical levels of inflammation
  in the local intestinal mucosa. Therefore, the colonic microbiota of non-secretors
  is altered at both the compositional and functional levels, affecting the host mucosal
  state and potentially explaining the association of FUT2 genotype and CD susceptibility.
