abstract: "BACKGROUND: Approximately, one-third to one-half of children with chronic\
  \ granulomatous disease (CGD) develop gastrointestinal inflammation characteristic\
  \ of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), usually Crohn's disease. We hypothesized\
  \ that the overall IBD genetic risk, determined by IBD genetic risk score (GRS),\
  \ might in part determine IBD development in CGD. METHODS: We reviewed medical records\
  \ to establish IBD diagnoses in CGD subjects seen at NIAID. IBD risk single nucleotide\
  \ polymorphism genotypes were determined using the Immunochip, and GRS were estimated\
  \ by Mangrove. RESULTS: Among 157 white patients with CGD, 55 were confirmed, 78\
  \ excluded, and 24 were uncertain for IBD. Two hundred one established, independent\
  \ European IBD risk single nucleotide polymorphisms passed quality control. After\
  \ sample quality control and removing non-IBD CGD patients with perianal disease,\
  \ mean GRS for 40 unrelated patients with CGD-IBD was higher than 53 CGD non-IBD\
  \ patients (in log2-scale 0.08 ± 1.62 versus -0.67 ± 1.64, P = 0.026) but lower\
  \ than 239 IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) young-onset Crohn's disease cases (0.76\
  \ ± 1.60, P = 0.025). GRS for non-IBD CGD was similar to 609 IBDGC controls (-0.69\
  \ ± 1.60, P = 0.95). Seven established IBD single nucleotide polymorphisms were\
  \ nominally significant among CGD-IBD versus CGD non-IBD, including those near LACC1\
  \ (P = 0.005), CXCL14 (P = 0.007), and TNFSF15 (P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: The weight\
  \ of the common IBD risk alleles are significant determinants of IBD in CGD. However,\
  \ IBD risk gene burden among CGD children with IBD is significantly lower than that\
  \ in nonsyndromic pediatric Crohn's disease, congruent with the concept that defective\
  \ superoxide production in CGD is also a major IBD risk factor. Individual IBD genes\
  \ might interact with the CGD defect to cause IBD in CGD."
