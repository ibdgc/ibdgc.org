## Gene Discoveries in Subjects with Crohnâ€™s Diseases of African Descent

ure a similar disease burden as Caucasians, yet less than 1% of research, publications, or clinical trials have focused on AA with CD. It remains to be seen whether these genetic markers will have prognostic utility in admixed individuals, such as AAs. Furthermore, AAs are at higher risk for disease complications and often have worse disease outcomes, suggesting that the underlying biology of CD in AAs may be different than Caucasians. The genome of AAs is admixed (~80% West African and 20% Caucasian), with greater diversity and shorter linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks. Higher levels of diversity can make genetic / post-GWAS studies more challenging, but identifying causal variants in AA may prove easier because of shorter physical LD region. We have successfully completed a well-powered GWAS for gene discoveries in AA. While common susceptibility variants discovered in Caucasians are also generally found in AAs with IBD, new AA-specific variants/loci in IBD, UC and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region along with several new regions of significant admixture linkage disequilibrium and multiple new signaling pathways. Following these exciting results and discoveries, we propose a post GWAS studies to comprehensively identify rare, causal and population specific variants in African Americans with CD.

## Functional Outcomes of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Associated Variants

The interplay between microbial and genetic susceptibility factors is central to the development of IBD. Innate mechanisms, in particular through pattern recognition receptor (PRR) pathways, are the initiating drivers of host responses to microbes. A central outcome of PRR activation by bacterial and viral products is induction of cytokine secretion. To a large extent, IBD is characterized by dysregulated cytokines, and modulation of cytokines plays a primary role in IBD treatment. We hypothesize that polymorphisms in multiple IBD-associated genes contribute to inter-individual variation in PRR-induced cytokine secretion. We will utilize a large, well- powered cohort to screen for IBD-associated polymorphisms contributing to the variation in PRR-initiated cytokine secretion across individuals, and then define the molecular mechanisms wherein the implicated IBD-associated genes, as well as the identified polymorphisms, regulate PRR-induced cytokine secretion.
