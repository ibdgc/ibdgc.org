Full Professor of Medicine at Université de Montréal and Senior Researcher at the Montreal Heart Institute (MHI) and holder the Canada Research Chair in Genetics and Genomic Medicine. Dr. Rioux received his Bachelor’s degree in Immunology and his PhD in Experimental Medicine from McGill University. He then went on to do post-doctoral training at the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research. In 1997, he launched a research group on the genetic and genomic basis of single-gene disorders and complex/polygenic diseases. He then created and directed the Inflammatory Diseases Research Group, first at Whitehead/MIT Center for Genome Research then at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. He was appointed Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School and at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in 2003 and became an Associate Member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, from 2004 until 2007.

Since his move to Montreal in 2005 Dr. Rioux has been the Director of the Laboratory in Genetics and Genomic Medicine of Inflammation, and more recently the Director of the MHI/UdeM Integrative Biology Platform and the High-Performance Sorting Platform. He is a founding member of multiple international consortia and currently co-leads the International IBD Genetics Consortium, is Chair of the Steering Committee of the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium and is the leader of the IBD Genomic Medicine (iGenoMed) Consortium.

Dr. Rioux’s research focuses on three main areas: (1) genetic studies to identify risk factors for common and rare diseases; (2) functional studies using human models, including iPSC-derived epithelial and immune models, to understand how genetic risk factors protect or predispose to disease; and (3) integrative human studies to identify biomarkers of important clinical outcomes, in particular response to molecularly-targeted therapies. Dr. Rioux’s work has led to over 200 publications, cited over 30,000 times.

##### NIDDK IBDGC-related funding:
**Montreal-Boston Collaborative IBD Genetic Research Center (DK062432; PI: Rioux)** The objective of this study is to identify the root causes of disease, so that we reveal the key targets for more precise and effective therapies for CD and UC in order to improve the quality of life of patients with CD and UC and eventually lead to the cure of these otherwise lifelong debilitating diseases.

**Specific Aim 1:** Develop patient and control resources that will enhance the Consortium’s capacity to identify genes, genetic variation and biological mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis of IBD  

**Specific Aim 2:** Pursue unique haplotype-based analyses in the French-Canadian population and integrate with Whole Exome Sequencing data to identify novel IBD causal variants.  
Specific Aim 3: Perform targeted functional studies of putative variants to advance our knowledge of biological impact of protective and predisposing alleles on cellular functions.

**Genotype-specific three-part model of human intestinal epithelium (DK062432; PI: Rioux)** The objective of this study is the development of robust and reproducible systems for generating and testing genotype-specific models of immune-epithelium-gut flora functions and interactions. Our strategy is based on human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology that had the potential of generating complex models combining intestinal epithelial cells, a variety of immune cells, as well as components of the intestinal flora, with the epithelial and immune cells being of specific genotypes.

**Understanding how a loss of epigenetic reader SP140 contributes to IBD (DK119996)**

NIDDK R01 Ancillary (K. Jeffrey, Leader; Rioux, PI of subaward) The overall objective of the present proposal is to utilize multiple resources from the IBD Genetics Consortium to precisely define the roles of SP140 in mediating protective innate and adaptive immunity toward commensal microorganisms, and determine how altered expression of this epigenome reader in patients bearing common or rare variants of SP140 impacts homeostasis in the gut.

##### Major Interests:
1. Genetic and genomic studies to identify risk factors for common and rare diseases; 
2. Functional studies using human models, including iPSC-derived epithelial and immune models, to understand how genetic risk factors protect or predispose to disease; and 
3. Integrative human studies to identify biomarkers of important clinical outcomes, in particular response to molecularly-targeted therapies.
