bio: ["Dermot McGovern completed his GI fellowship and obtained a PhD in complex disease genetics at the University of Oxford, England before moving to Cedars-Sinai, Los Angeles 11 years ago. Dr McGovern is the Director of Translational Medicine at the F. Widjaja Foundation Imflammatory Bowel and Immunobiology Research Institute at Cedars-Sinai and also directs the Cedars-Sinai Precision Medicine Initiative. He holds the Joshua and Lisa Greer Endowed Chair in IBD Genetics. Dr. McGovern’s clinical interests include the extra-intestinal complications of IBD and also the overlap between IBD and other immune-mediated and metabolic diseases. Dr. McGovern serves on the National Scientific Advisory Committee for the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation as well as the steering committees of the National and International IBD Genetics Consortia. He also chairs the CCFA local advisory medical committee. Dr. McGovern serves on the editorial board for the IBD Journal. He has been elected a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation (ASCI) and also the International Organization for the Study of IBD (IOIBD). Dr. McGovern’s group is funded by the NIH to study the effect of genetics on the susceptibility to and natural history of IBD in diverse populations. Dr McGovern’s group analyze multi’-omic’ datasets to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of IBD that ‘feed’ the Drug Development Unit he co-directs. His group also have a significant interest in the pharmacogenetics of therapies used in IBD. Extending these studies to diverse populations including African-Americans, Hispanics, and the Ashkenazi Jewish population is a major focus of his group. His group is also funded by the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation, The Litwin Foundation, and the Helmsley Charitable Trust. Dr. McGovern’s group have published approximately 150 peer-reviewed papers in journals including Nature, Science, Cell, Nature Genetics, The Lancet, and Gastroenterology."]

# NIDDK IBDGC-related funding

The Cedars GRC, together with the IBD genetics community, has contributed to
the enormous advances in IBD genetics over the last few years. Over 200 IBD
susceptibility loci have been identified but many challenges remain. Through
this proposal we plan to address a number of these issues. To date, there has
been little direct impact on clinical care from IBD genetic advances. In
specific aim 1 we will address very significant unmet medical needs adopting
novel methods, expertise from both academia and industry and truly unique
cohorts to determine factors associated with true-non response to anti-TNFs as
well as factors associated with pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity after
biologic treatment. Similarly, we will leverage collaborations from around the
world to study the largest cohort of perianal fistulizing Crohn’s disease, a
particularly severe phenotype of disease that responds poorly to medication
and has a high prevalence in African-Americans.

**SPECIFIC AIM 1:** Define genetic determinants of unmet medical needs in
inflammatory bowel disease.

Sub-aim 1a: Define genetic factors associated with true non-response (TNR),
pharmacokinetic, and immunogenic parameters of biologic therapies in IBD.

Sub-aim 1b: Define genetic variation associated with the development of
perianal Crohn’s disease.

**SPECIFIC AIM 2** Functional characterization of genetic risk variants
associated with IBD.

Sub-aim 2a. Characterization of the regulatory landscape in ileal CD tissues.

Sub-aim 2b: Functional characterization of tissue specific regulatory and
transcriptomic landscapes for IBD risk loci.

Sub-aim 2c: Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis of IBD risk
regions.

Sub-aim 2d: Connecting IBD-associated regulatory variants to target genes
using chromosome conformation capture assays.

**SPECIFIC AIM 3:** Defining novel genetic determinants and environment
interplay of Paneth cell phenotypes in CD patients

Sub-aim 3a: Determine the genetic associations, molecular mechanisms, and
clinical relevance of Paneth cell defects in European ancestry CD.

Sub-aim 3b: Determine the genetic associations, molecular mechanisms, and
clinical relevance of Paneth cell defects in East Asian ancestry CD patients

Sub-aim 3c: Determine the genetic associations, molecular mechanisms, and
clinical relevance of Paneth cell defects in African American and Hispanic CD
patients

# Interests of the Cedars-Sinai GRC group beyond the GRC abstract

1. Genetic and genomic studies to identify risk factors for IBD and also to
   study pleiotropic effects between IBD and other traits.
2. Genotype x Phenotype studies (clinical, radiological, histological)
3. Genotype x Microbiome Studies
4. Non-Northern European IBD population studies (Ashkenazi Jews, East Asians,
   African Americans, Hispanics).
5. Pharmacogenomics
