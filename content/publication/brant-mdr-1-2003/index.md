abstract: Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are overlapping chronic inflammatory
  bowel diseases (IBDs). Suggestive evidence for linkage at chromosome 7q has been
  reported for both CD and UC. Contained within this region is the gene for MDR1 (multidrug
  resistance), a membrane transport protein for which human polymorphisms have been
  reported in Ala893Ser/Thr and C3435T that alter pharmacokinetic profiles for a variety
  of drugs. Because mdr1 knockout mice spontaneously develop colitis, exonic regions
  were resequenced and tested for IBD association in a large, multicenter North American
  cohort. Two missense mutations, Asn21Asp and Ala893Ser/Thr, as well as the expression-associated
  polymorphism C3435T, described elsewhere, were genotyped in the entire cohort. Significant
  association of Ala893 with IBD was observed by both case-control analysis (P=.002)
  and the pedigree disequilibrium test (PDT [P=.00020-.00030]) but not for the Asn21Asp
  or C3435T polymorphisms. Significant association by PDT was observed within the
  subset with CD (P=.0014-.00090), with similar, nonsignificant trends in a smaller
  subset with UC. The Ala893Ser/Thr variant is triallelic, and the associated, common
  allele is Ala893, with undertransmission of the 893Ser (common) and the 893Thr (rare)
  variants. The Ala893 variant has decreased activity compared with the 893Ser variant;
  therefore, the association with human IBD is consistent with the murine model of
  mdr1 deficiency. Taken together, these data support the association of the common
  Ala893 polymorphism with IBD specifically and, more broadly, provides additional
  support for its contribution to interindividual pharmacogenetic variation.
