abstract: Polymorphisms in C1orf106 are associated with increased risk of inflammatory
  bowel disease (IBD). However, the function of C1orf106 and the consequences of disease-associated
  polymorphisms are unknown. Here we demonstrate that C1orf106 regulates adherens
  junction stability by regulating the degradation of cytohesin-1, a guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor that controls activation of ARF6. By limiting cytohesin-1-dependent
  ARF6 activation, C1orf106 stabilizes adherens junctions. Consistent with this model,
  C1orf106-/- mice exhibit defects in the intestinal epithelial cell barrier, a phenotype
  observed in IBD patients that confers increased susceptibility to intestinal pathogens.
  Furthermore, the IBD risk variant increases C1orf106 ubiquitination and turnover
  with consequent functional impairments. These findings delineate a mechanism by
  which a genetic polymorphism fine-tunes intestinal epithelial barrier integrity
  and elucidate a fundamental mechanism of cellular junctional control.
