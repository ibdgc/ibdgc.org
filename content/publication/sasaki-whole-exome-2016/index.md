abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Rare variants (textless1%) likely contribute significantly
  to risk for common diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in specific
  patient subsets, such as those with high familiality. They are, however, extraordinarily
  challenging to identify. METHODS: To discover candidate rare variants associated
  with IBD, we performed whole-exome sequencing on 6 members of a pediatric-onset
  IBD family with multiple affected individuals. To determine whether the variants
  discovered in this family are also associated with nonfamilial IBD, we investigated
  their influence on disease in 2 large case-control (CC) series. RESULTS: We identified
  2 rare variants, rs142430606 and rs200958270, both in the established IBD-susceptibility
  gene IL17REL, carried by all 4 affected family members and their obligate carrier
  parents. We then demonstrated that both variants are associated with sporadic ulcerative
  colitis (UC) in 2 independent data sets. For UC in CC 1: rs142430606 (odds ratio
  [OR] = 2.99, Padj = 0.028; minor allele frequency [MAF]cases = 0.0063, MAFcontrols
  = 0.0021); rs200958270 (OR = 2.61, Padj = 0.082; MAFcases = 0.0045, MAFcontrols
  = 0.0017). For UC in CC 2: rs142430606 (OR = 1.94, P = 0.0056; MAFcases = 0.0071,
  MAFcontrols = 0.0045); rs200958270 (OR = 2.08, P = 0.0028; MAFcases = 0.0071, MAFcontrols
  = 0.0042). CONCLUSIONS: We discover in a family and replicate in 2 CC data sets
  2 rare susceptibility variants for IBD, both in IL17REL. Our results illustrate
  that whole-exome sequencing performed on disease-enriched families to guide association
  testing can be an efficient strategy for the discovery of rare disease-associated
  variants. We speculate that rare variants identified in families and confirmed in
  the general population may be important modifiers of disease risk for patients with
  a family history, and that genetic testing of these variants may be warranted in
  this patient subset.'
