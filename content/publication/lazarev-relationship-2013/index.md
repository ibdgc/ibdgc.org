abstract: "OBJECTIVES: In classifying Crohn's disease (CD) location, proximal (L4)\
  \ disease includes esophagogastroduodenal (EGD) and jejunal disease. Our aim was\
  \ to determine the influence of proximal disease on outcomes of behavior and need\
  \ for surgery and to determine if there was significant clinical heterogeneity between\
  \ EGD and jejunal disease. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional query of the\
  \ NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease) Inflammatory\
  \ Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) database of patients with a confirmed\
  \ diagnosis of CD and phenotyped per the IBDGC manual. Presence of any L4, L4-EGD,\
  \ L4-jejunal, and non-L4 disease (L1-ileal, L2-colonic, and L3-ileocolonic) was\
  \ compared with demographic features including age, race, ethnicity, smoking and\
  \ inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) family history, diagnosis age, disease duration,\
  \ clinical outcomes of inflammatory, stricturing or penetrating behavior, and CD\
  \ abdominal surgeries. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed with\
  \ R. RESULTS: Among 2,105 patients with complete disease location data, 346 had\
  \ L4 disease (175 L4-EGD, 115 L4-jejunal, and 56 EGD and jejunal) with 321 having\
  \ concurrent L1-L3 disease. In all, 1,759 had only L1-L3 disease. L4 vs. non-L4\
  \ patients were more likely (Ptextless0.001) to be younger at diagnosis, non-smokers,\
  \ have coexisting ileal involvement, and have stricturing disease. L4-jejunal vs.\
  \ L4-EGD patients were at least twice as likely (Ptextless0.001) to have had ileal\
  \ disease, stricturing behavior, and any or multiple abdominal surgeries. Remarkably,\
  \ L4-jejunal patients had more (Ptextless0.001) stricturing behavior and multiple\
  \ abdominal surgeries than non-L4 ileal disease patients. Logistic regression showed\
  \ stricturing risks were ileal (without proximal) site (odds ratio (OR) 3.18; 95%\
  \ confidence interval 2.23-4.64), longer disease duration (OR 1.33/decade; 1.19-1.49),\
  \ jejunal site (OR 2.90; 1.89-4.45), and older age at diagnosis (OR 1.21/decade;\
  \ 1.10-1.34). Multiple surgery risks were disease duration (OR 3.74/decade; 3.05-4.64),\
  \ penetrating disease (OR 2.60; 1.64-4.21), and jejunal site (OR 2.39; 1.36-4.20),\
  \ with short duration from diagnosis to first surgery protective (OR 0.87/decade\
  \ to first surgery; 0.84-0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Jejunal disease is a significantly\
  \ greater risk factor for stricturing disease and multiple abdominal surgeries than\
  \ either EGD or ileal (without proximal) disease. The Montreal site classification\
  \ should be revised to include separate designations for jejunal and EGD disease."
