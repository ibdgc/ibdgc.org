abstract: Salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) are promising therapeutic targets for modulating
  cytokine responses during innate immune activation. The study of SIK inhibition
  in animal models of disease has been limited by the lack of selective small-molecule
  probes suitable for modulating SIK function in vivo. We used the pan-SIK inhibitor
  HG-9-91-01 as a starting point to develop improved analogs, yielding a novel probe
  5 (YKL-05-099) that displays increased selectivity for SIKs versus other kinases
  and enhanced pharmacokinetic properties. Well-tolerated doses of YKL-05-099 achieve
  free serum concentrations above its IC50 for SIK2 inhibition for textgreater16 h
  and reduce phosphorylation of a known SIK substrate in vivo. While in vivo active
  doses of YKL-05-099 recapitulate the effects of SIK inhibition on inflammatory cytokine
  responses, they did not induce metabolic abnormalities observed in Sik2 knockout
  mice. These results identify YKL-05-099 as a useful probe to investigate SIK function
  in vivo and further support the development of SIK inhibitors for treatment of inflammatory
  disorders.
