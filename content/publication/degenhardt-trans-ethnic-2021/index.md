abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the
  gut. Genetic association studies have identified the highly variable human leukocyte
  antigen (HLA) region as the strongest susceptibility locus for IBD, and specifically
  DRB1*01:03 as a determining factor for ulcerative colitis (UC). However, for most
  of the association signal such a delineation could not be made due to tight structures
  of linkage disequilibrium within the HLA. The aim of this study was therefore to
  further characterize the HLA signal using a trans-ethnic approach. We performed
  a comprehensive fine mapping of single HLA alleles in UC in a cohort of 9272 individuals
  with African American, East Asian, Puerto Rican, Indian and Iranian descent and
  40 691 previously analyzed Caucasians, additionally analyzing whole HLA haplotypes.
  We computationally characterized the binding of associated HLA alleles to human
  self-peptides and analysed the physico-chemical properties of the HLA proteins and
  predicted self-peptidomes. Highlighting alleles of the HLA-DRB1*15 group and their
  correlated HLA-DQ-DR haplotypes, we identified consistent associations (regarding
  effects directions/magnitudes) across different ethnicities but also identified
  population-specific signals (regarding differences in allele frequencies). We observed
  that DRB1*01:03 is mostly present in individuals of Western European descent and
  hardly present in non-Caucasian individuals. We found peptides predicted to bind
  to risk HLA alleles to be rich in positively charged amino acids such. We conclude
  that the HLA plays an important role for UC susceptibility across different ethnicities.
  This research further implicates specific features of peptides that are predicted
  to bind risk and protective HLA proteins.
