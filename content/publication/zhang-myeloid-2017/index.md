abstract: Intact ATG16L1 plays an essential role in Paneth cell function and intestinal
  homeostasis. However, the functional consequences of ATG16L1 deficiency in myeloid
  cells, particularly macrophages, are not fully characterized. We generated mice
  with Atg16l1 deficiency in myeloid and dendritic cells and showed that mice with
  myeloid Atg16l1 deficiency had exacerbated colitis in two acute and one chronic
  model of colitis with increased proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory macrophage
  ratios, production of proinflammatory cytokines, and numbers of IgA-coated intestinal
  microbes. Mechanistic analyses using primary murine macrophages showed that Atg16l1
  deficiency led to increased reactive oxygen species production, impaired mitophagy,
  reduced microbial killing, impaired processing of MHC class II Ags, and altered
  intracellular trafficking to the lysosomal compartments. Increased production of
  reactive oxygen species and reduced microbial killing may be general features of
  the myeloid compartment, as they were also observed in Atg16l1-deficient primary
  murine neutrophils. A missense polymorphism (Thr300Ala) in the essential autophagy
  gene ATG16L1 is associated with Crohn disease (CD). Previous studies showed that
  this polymorphism leads to enhanced cleavage of ATG16L1 T300A protein and thus reduced
  autophagy. Similar findings were shown in primary human macrophages from controls
  and a population of CD patients carrying the Atg16l1 T300A risk variant and who
  were controlled for NOD2 CD-associated variants. This study revealed that ATG16L1
  deficiency led to alterations in macrophage function that contribute to the severity
  of CD.
