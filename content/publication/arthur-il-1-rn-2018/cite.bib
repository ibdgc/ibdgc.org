 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) susceptibility loci that were identified by candidate gene studies demonstrate association with systemic JIA in the largest study population assembled to date.  METHODS: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 11 previously reported systemic JIA risk loci were examined for association in 9 populations, including  770 patients with systemic JIA and 6,947 controls. The effect of systemic},
