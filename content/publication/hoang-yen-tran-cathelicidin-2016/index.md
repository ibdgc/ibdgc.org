abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Obesity is a global epidemic which increases
  the risk of the metabolic syndrome. Cathelicidin (LL-37 and mCRAMP) is an antimicrobial
  peptide with an unknown role in obesity. We hypothesize that cathelicidin expression
  correlates with obesity and modulates fat mass and hepatic steatosis. MATERIALS
  AND METHODS: Male C57BL/6â€‰J mice were fed a high-fat diet. Streptozotocin was injected
  into mice to induce diabetes. Experimental groups were injected with cathelicidin
  and CD36 overexpressing lentiviruses. Human mesenteric fat adipocytes, mouse 3T3-L1
  differentiated adipocytes and human HepG2 hepatocytes were used in the in vitro
  experiments. Cathelicidin levels in non-diabetic, prediabetic and type II diabetic
  patients were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Lentiviral
  cathelicidin overexpression reduced hepatic steatosis and decreased the fat mass
  of high-fat diet-treated diabetic mice. Cathelicidin overexpression reduced mesenteric
  fat and hepatic fatty acid translocase (CD36) expression that was reversed by lentiviral
  CD36 overexpression. Exposure of adipocytes and hepatocytes to cathelicidin significantly
  inhibited CD36 expression and reduced lipid accumulation. Serum cathelicidin protein
  levels were significantly increased in non-diabetic and prediabetic patients with
  obesity, compared with non-diabetic patients with normal body mass index (BMI) values.
  Prediabetic patients had lower serum cathelicidin protein levels than non-diabetic
  subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Cathelicidin inhibits the CD36 fat receptor and lipid accumulation
  in adipocytes and hepatocytes, leading to a reduction of fat mass and hepatic steatosis
  in vivo. Circulating cathelicidin levels are associated with increased BMI. Our
  results demonstrate that cathelicidin modulates the development of obesity.'
