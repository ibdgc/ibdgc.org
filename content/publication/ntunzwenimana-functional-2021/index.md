abstract: "BACKGROUND: Genetic studies have been tremendously successful in identifying\
  \ genomic regions associated with a wide variety of phenotypes, although the success\
  \ of these studies in identifying causal genes, their variants, and their functional\
  \ impacts has been more limited. METHODS: We identified 145 genes from IBD-associated\
  \ genomic loci having endogenous expression within the intestinal epithelial cell\
  \ compartment. We evaluated the impact of lentiviral transfer of the open reading\
  \ frame (ORF) of these IBD genes into the HT-29 intestinal epithelial cell line\
  \ via transcriptomic analyses. By comparing the genes in which expression was modulated\
  \ by each ORF, as well as the functions enriched within these gene lists, we identified\
  \ ORFs with shared impacts and their putative disease-relevant biological functions.\
  \ RESULTS: Analysis of the transcriptomic data for cell lines expressing the ORFs\
  \ for known causal genes such as HNF4a, IFIH1, and SMAD3 identified functions consistent\
  \ with what is already known for these genes. These analyses also identified two\
  \ major clusters of genes: Cluster 1 contained the known IBD causal genes IFIH1,\
  \ SBNO2, NFKB1, and NOD2, as well as genes from other IBD loci (ZFP36L1, IRF1, GIGYF1,\
  \ OTUD3, AIRE and PITX1), whereas Cluster 2 contained the known causal gene KSR1\
  \ and implicated DUSP16 from another IBD locus. Our analyses highlight how multiple\
  \ IBD gene candidates can impact on epithelial structure and function, including\
  \ the protection of the mucosa from intestinal microbiota, and demonstrate that\
  \ DUSP16 acts a regulator of MAPK activity and contributes to mucosal defense, in\
  \ part via its regulation of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, involved in\
  \ the protection of the intestinal mucosa from enteric microbiota. CONCLUSIONS:\
  \ This functional screen, based on expressing IBD genes within an appropriate cellular\
  \ context, in this instance intestinal epithelial cells, resulted in changes to\
  \ the cell's transcriptome that are relevant to their endogenous biological function(s).\
  \ This not only helped in identifying likely causal genes within genetic loci but\
  \ also provided insight into their biological functions. Furthermore, this work\
  \ has highlighted the central role of intestinal epithelial cells in IBD pathophysiology,\
  \ providing a scientific rationale for a drug development strategy that targets\
  \ epithelial functions in addition to the current therapies targeting immune functions."
