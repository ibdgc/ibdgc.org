abstract: "BACKGROUND: The IL-23 pathway plays a pivotal role in the development of\
  \ chronic mucosal inflammation seen in the inflammatory bowel diseases. Multiple\
  \ studies have now established the contribution of the interleukin 23 receptor gene\
  \ (IL23R) to Crohn's disease (CD) risk in general and of the IL23R R381Q variant\
  \ in particular. The aim of this work was to estimate the total contribution of\
  \ this gene to CD risk test using a haplotype approach. METHODS: In all, 763 CD\
  \ subjects and 254 controls were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms in\
  \ the IL23R gene using Illumina and ABI methods. Haplotypes were assigned using\
  \ PHASEv2 and tested for association with CD by chi-square and permutation. RESULTS:\
  \ Haplotypes with both increased and decreased risk for CD were observed in 2 of\
  \ the 4 observed blocks (Block 2 H1: 55.4% control, 64% CD, P = 0.019; H2: 64.5%\
  \ control, 54.4% CD, P = 0.006; Block 3 H1: 55.8% control, 64.4% CD, P = 0.013;\
  \ H2: 47.0% control, 36.6% CD, P = 0.001). The population attributable risk for\
  \ these haplotypes was substantially larger than that estimated for the IL23R R381Q\
  \ variant (Block 2 H1 and block 3 H1 approximately 20%, compared with approximately\
  \ 4% for Block 3 H6, containing the variant). CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest\
  \ that IL23R makes a substantial contribution to CD susceptibility, larger than\
  \ that estimated from the population frequency of the R381Q variant. These observations\
  \ also support the expectation that finding \\\"hits\\\" from genomewide association\
  \ studies will be but an important chapter in the story of unraveling the genetic\
  \ contribution to CD, rather than the final chapter that brings clarity to all the\
  \ plot twists of a complicated story."
