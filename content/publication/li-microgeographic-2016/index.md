abstract: "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Interactions between mucosal cell types, environmental\
  \ stressors, and intestinal microbiota contribute to pathogenesis in inflammatory\
  \ bowel disease (IBD). Here, we applied metaproteomics of the mucosal-luminal interface\
  \ to study the disease-related biology of the human colonic mucosa. METHODS: We\
  \ recruited a discovery cohort of 51 IBD and non-IBD subjects endoscopically sampled\
  \ by mucosal lavage at 6 colonic regions, and a validation cohort of 38 no-IBD subjects.\
  \ Metaproteome data sets were produced for each sample and analyzed for association\
  \ with colonic site and disease state using a suite of bioinformatic approaches.\
  \ Localization of select proteins was determined by immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemistry\
  \ of human endoscopic biopsy samples. RESULTS: Co-occurrence analysis of the discovery\
  \ cohort metaproteome showed that proteins at the mucosal surface clustered into\
  \ modules with evidence of differential functional specialization (eg, iron regulation,\
  \ microbial defense) and cellular origin (eg, epithelial or hemopoietic). These\
  \ modules, validated in an independent cohort, were differentially associated spatially\
  \ along the gastrointestinal tract, and 7 modules were associated selectively with\
  \ non-IBD, ulcerative colitis, and/or Crohn's disease states. In addition, the detailed\
  \ composition of certain modules was altered in disease vs healthy states. We confirmed\
  \ the predicted spatial and disease-associated localization of 28 proteins representing\
  \ 4 different disease-related modules by immunoblot and immunohistochemistry visualization,\
  \ with evidence for their distribution as millimeter-scale microgeographic mosaic.\
  \ CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the mucosal surface is a microgeographic\
  \ mosaic of functional networks reflecting the local mucosal ecology, whose compositional\
  \ differences in disease and healthy samples may provide a unique readout of physiologic\
  \ and pathologic mucosal states."
