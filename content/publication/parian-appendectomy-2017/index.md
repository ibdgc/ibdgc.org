abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Early appendectomy is inversely associated with the development
  of UC. However, the impact of appendectomy on the clinical course of UC is controversial,
  generally favouring a milder disease course. We aim to describe the effect appendectomy
  has on the disease course of UC with focus on the timing of appendectomy in relation
  to UC diagnosis. DESIGN: Using the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive
  and Kidney Diseases Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium database of patients
  with UC, the risk of colectomy was compared between patients who did and did not
  undergo appendectomy. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis of studies that
  examined the association between appendectomy and colectomy. RESULTS: 2980 patients
  with UC were initially included. 111 (4.4%) patients with UC had an appendectomy;
  of which 63 were performed prior to UC diagnosis and 48 after diagnosis. In multivariable
  analysis, appendectomy performed at any time was an independent risk factor for
  colectomy (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.1), with appendectomy performed after UC diagnosis
  most strongly associated with colectomy (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.5). An updated
  meta-analysis showed appendectomy performed either prior to or after UC diagnosis
  had no effect on colectomy rates. CONCLUSIONS: Appendectomy performed at any time
  in relation to UC diagnosis was not associated with a decrease in severity of disease.
  In fact, appendectomy after UC diagnosis may be associated with a higher risk of
  colectomy. These findings question the proposed use of appendectomy as treatment
  for UC.'
