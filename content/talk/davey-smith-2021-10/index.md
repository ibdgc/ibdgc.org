Professor George Davey Smith is a clinical epidemiologist, director of the MRC
Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) at the University of Bristol and
Scientific Director of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.

Professor Davey Smithâ€™s research has pioneered understanding of the causes and
alleviation of health inequalities; lifecourse epidemiology; systematic
reviewing of epidemiological evidence; and the study of population health
contributions of the new genetics. He is particularly interested in developing
and applying Mendelian randomization approaches, interrogating the causal role
of behavioral factors (such as alcohol consumption) and intermediate
phenotypes on different health outcomes, such as cardiovascular diseases and
type 2 diabetes.
