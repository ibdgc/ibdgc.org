### NIDDK IBDGC-related funding

#### Rutgers-Hopkins Collaborative IBD Genetic Research Center (DK62431; PI: Brant)

Major goals are to recruit African American patients and controls for an NIDDK repository, assess and identify susceptibility genes for IBD in the African American population and work on other gene discovery in conjunction with the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium

#### Specific Aims

**Aim 1:**  Expand the African American (AA) IBD study population for gene mapping

**Aim 2:**  Further identify disease variants for AA IBD by various methods including WGS for low frequency alleles, sex-specific analyses, admixture mapping, sex-based analyses, and novel association discovery by incorporating gene expression data and pathway analyses

**Aim 3:** examine gene expression in colonic epithelium from African Americans to identify differentially expressed genes and eQTLs relevant to ulcerative colitis in African Americans.

**Aim 4:** determine if differences in open chromatin explains genetic loci with differential IBD genetic association by ethnic ancestry between whites, East Asians and AA’s.

#### Administrative Supplement

Evaluate pre-diagnostic sera for metabolites that are signatures of microbes that interact with Crohns disease (CD) innate immunity risk genes leading to development of CD

#### Ancillary Liaisons (Active; Dr. Brant is Coinvestigator on each project)

#### Major interests

- Identification and characterization of inflammatory bowel disease risk genes in diverse populations, particularly in African Americans 
- Determine the causes of differential IBD genetic association by ancestry  
- Identify root causes of inflammatory bowel disease by exploration of gene-environmental and gene-gene interactions
