#bio: ["After graduating from the University of Toronto, Faculty of Medicine in 1992, Dr. Mark Silverberg completed his internal medicine and gastroenterology training in Toronto in 1997. He then obtained a PhD studying the genetics of inflammatory bowel disease in 2002 at the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute of Mount Sinai Hospital. He is currently a Professor and Clinician Scientist in the Department of Medicine and holds the Gale and Graham Wright Research Chair in Digestive Diseases. He runs a laboratory based at Mount Sinai Hospital and the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute investigating the causes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).", "His research program has been funded by grants from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK/NIH), Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Crohn's and Colitis Canada (CCC) and the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA). His laboratory has focused on identifying susceptibility genes for IBD and to explain the contribution of genes and other biomarkers to its etiology and clinical course.", "More recently he has expanded his program to study the relationship between serum immune responses, gene regulation and the host microbiome with genetic susceptibility. He has made significant contributions to the discovery of genes related to Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and paediatric IBD. He also has made major contributions to clinical IBD research in the field of phenomics, classification of IBD (The Montreal Classification) and as well as in optimal use of biologic therapy and therapeutic drug monitoring.", "Dr. Silverberg has taken leadership positions on several international collaborative efforts with the goal of expediting scientific progress in the field of IBD. These include the International IBD Genetics Consortium, the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium and the CCFA Microbiome Initiative. Dr. Silverberg is also currently the Director of the Advanced IBD Fellowship Program at MSH and co-director of the Canadian GI Fellows Program in IBD.", "His current projects are directed toward understanding the relationship between the microbiome in the digestive tract and host genotype allowing more insight into the role of diet and how food may trigger or exacerbate IBD. Ultimately he hopes to develop tools that will allow clinicians to better predict who may develop IBD and to identify high-risk patients so that a more personalized approach to treatment based on patients' unique genetic and bacterial signatures may be employed. Dr. Silverberg also runs a large clinical practice focused on IBD at Mount Sinai Hospital."]

### NIDDK IBDGC-related funding

#### Specific Aims:

**Aim 1)** To support the IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) to continue the discovery of genetic variation associated with IBD and its meaningful phenotypes. In particular, the IBDGC proposes to fully characterize: (a) the genetic architecture of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in patients of non-European ancestry (EA) as well as important phenotypes with significant etiological and clinical unmet needs, namely; (b) acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) and; (c) perianal Crohn’s disease (pCD).

**Aim 2)** To identify the cellular, genomic and microbial characteristics underlying persistent microscopic colonic inflammation in ulcerative colitis (UC) and the mechanisms leading to disease relapse and colitis-associated neoplasia.

**Aim 3)** Intestinal Cell State and Immune Profiling to Characterize Advanced Therapy  (AT) responsive and Refractory Crohn’s disease (CD).

#### Administrative Supplement

3U01DK062423-17S1 and 18S1 (PI: Dr. Silverberg)

Title: Diet intervention as a prebiotic treatment for active ulcerative colitis
The purpose of this study is to determine if a sustainable non-elemental diet can be used as a probiotic tool to alter the dysbiotic microbiome found in individuals with ulcerative colitis and thereby decrease disease activity.

#### Major interests:

My research interests for the past 20 years are to evaluate the role of genetic, microbial, and other biomarkers in the etiology, classification and clinical course of IBD. Since 2002 my lab has been funded continuously by the NIH/NIDDK. I have extensive experience with large scale collaborative research projects. I have been a member of the Steering Committee for the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium since its inception and am a previous member of the CCFA Microbiome Consortium. I am a Senior Advisor to the Canadian IBD Research Consortium (CIRC) and a Steering Committee Member of the Canadian National GEM Project. My position at Sinai Health System provides me access to more than 5000 IBD-affected subjects that come to our institution annually. Nearly all of our patients are followed longitudinally and we have research ethics permissions in place on an ongoing basis to re-contact subjects for whom we have DNA and other biospecimens/clinical data. My team is extremely experienced at collecting high quality biospecimens from human subjects for genetics and microbiome studies. My lab has accumulated samples and data on more than 9000 subjects since 2003. My publications and presentations have demonstrated successful experience in the genomics, serology, transcriptomics and microbiome fields. I also have significant experience and expertise in the clinical management of IBD. I am the Founder and Past Director of the Mount Sinai Hospital Advanced IBD Fellowship Program which was initiated to bring post-doctoral trainees to our institution for research fellowships. We have trained Fellows from the UK, USA, Ireland, Australia, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Israel, USA, Saudi Arabia and Canada and many of these fellows have made significant contributions to the activities of the IBDGC. It is my mission to unravel the etiology of IBD and to improve the lives of those affected by it.
