abstract: 'BACKGROUND & AIMS: RAC1 is a guanosine triphosphatase that has an evolutionarily  conserved
  role in coordinating immune defenses, from plants to mammals. Chronic inflammatory
  bowel diseases are associated with dysregulation of immune defenses. We studied
  the role of RAC1 in inflammatory bowel diseases using human genetic and functional
  studies and animal models of colitis. METHODS: We used a candidate gene approach
  to HapMap-Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms in a discovery cohort; findings were
  confirmed in 2 additional cohorts. RAC1 messenger RNA expression was examined from
  peripheral blood cells of patients. Colitis was induced in mice with conditional
  disruption of Rac1 in phagocytes by administration of dextran sulfate sodium. RESULTS:
  We observed a genetic association between RAC1 with ulcerative colitis in a discovery
  cohort, 2 independent replication cohorts, and in combined analysis for the single
  nucleotide polymorphisms rs10951982 (P(combined UC) = 3.3 x 10(-8), odds ratio =  1.43
  [95% confidence interval: 1.26-1.63]) and rs4720672 (P(combined UC) = 4.7 x  10(-6),
  odds ratio = 1.36 [95% confidence interval: 1.19-1.58]). Patients with inflammatory
  bowel disease who had the rs10951982 risk allele had increased expression of RAC1
  compared to those without this allele. Conditional disruption  of Rac1 in macrophage
  and neutrophils of mice protected against dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis.
  CONCLUSIONS: Human studies and knockout mice demonstrated a role for the guanosine
  triphosphatase RAC1 in the development of ulcerative colitis; increased expression
  of RAC1 was associated with susceptibility to colitis.'
