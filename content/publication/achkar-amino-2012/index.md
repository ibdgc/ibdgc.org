abstract: The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p is an established
  risk locus for ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to better
  define MHC association signals in UC and CD by combining data from dense single-nucleotide
  polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and from imputation of classical  human leukocyte
  antigen (HLA) types, their constituent SNPs and corresponding amino acids in 562
  UC, 611 CD and 1428 control subjects. Univariate and multivariate association analyses
  were performed, controlling for ancestry. In univariate analyses, absence of the
  rs9269955 C allele was strongly associated with risk for UC (P = 2.67 x 10(-13)).
  rs9269955 is a SNP in the codon for amino  acid position 11 of HLA-DRbeta1, located
  in the P6 pocket of the HLA-DR antigen binding cleft. This amino acid position was
  also the most significantly
