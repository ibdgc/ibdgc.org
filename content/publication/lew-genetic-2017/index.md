abstract: "AIM: To study the type and frequency of adverse events associated with\
  \ anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy and evaluate for any serologic and genetic\
  \ associations. METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of patients attending\
  \ the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) centers at Cedars-Sinai IBD Center from 2005-2016.\
  \ Adverse events were identified via chart review. IBD serologies were measured\
  \ by ELISA. DNA samples were genotyped at Cedars-Sinai using Illumina Infinium Immunochipv1\
  \ array per manufacturer's protocol. SNPs underwent methodological review and were\
  \ evaluated using several SNP statistic parameters to ensure optimal allele-calling.\
  \ Standard and rigorous QC criteria were applied to the genetic data, which was\
  \ generated using immunochip. Genetic association was assessed by logistic regression\
  \ after correcting for population structure. RESULTS: Altogether we identified 1258\
  \ IBD subjects exposed to anti-TNF agents in whom Immunochip data were available.\
  \ 269/1258 patients (21%) were found to have adverse events to an anti-TNF-Î± agent\
  \ that required the therapy to be discontinued. 25% of women compared to 17% of\
  \ men experienced an adverse event. All adverse events resolved after discontinuing\
  \ the anti-TNF agent. In total: n = 66 (5%) infusion reactions; n = 49 (4%) allergic/serum\
  \ sickness reactions; n = 19 (1.5%) lupus-like reactions, n = 52 (4%) rash, n =\
  \ 18 (1.4%) infections. In Crohn's disease, IgA ASCA (P = 0.04) and IgG-ASCA (P\
  \ = 0.02) levels were also lower in patients with any adverse events, and anti-I2\
  \ level in ulcerative colitis was significantly associated with infusion reactions\
  \ (P = 0.008). The logistic regression/human annotation and network analyses performed\
  \ on the Immunochip data implicated the following five signaling pathways: JAK-STAT\
  \ (Janus Kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription), measles, IBD,\
  \ cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and toxoplasmosis for any adverse event.\
  \ CONCLUSION: Our study shows 1 in 5 IBD patients experience an adverse event to\
  \ anti-TNF therapy with novel serologic, genetic , and pathways associations."
