abstract: "BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in utilization of major surgical procedures\
  \ have been well documented in the United States over the last decade. Crohn's disease\
  \ (CD) is a chronically relapsing disorder that leads to significant morbidity and,\
  \ in most cases, surgery. Our objective was to characterize health disparities in\
  \ CD-related bowel resection among hospitalized CD patients. METHODS: We analyzed\
  \ discharge records from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, the largest nationally\
  \ representative database of acute-care hospitals throughout the United States.\
  \ A total of 41,918 discharges with CD from 1998 to 2003 were included. Bowel resection\
  \ and in-hospital mortality rates for non-Hispanic whites, African Americans, Hispanics,\
  \ and non-Hispanic Asians were calculated. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, sex,\
  \ health insurance, comorbidity, median neighborhood income, and hospital characteristics,\
  \ the relative rate ratio of undergoing bowel resection for African Americans, Hispanics,\
  \ and Asians compared to whites was 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.61-0.76),\
  \ 0.70 (95% CI: 0.60-0.83), and 0.31 (95% CI: 0.16-0.59), respectively. Compared\
  \ to those with private insurance, the relative risk of surgery for those with Medicare,\
  \ those with Medicaid, and those who were \\\"self-pay\\\" was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.44-0.54),\
  \ 0.52 (95% CI: 0.46-0.59), and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.58-0.77), respectively. Women were\
  \ less likely than men to undergo bowel resection (incidence rate ratio [IRR] =\
  \ 0.80; 95% CI: 0.76-0.85). The in-hospital mortality of individuals who resided\
  \ in neighborhoods whose median income was above the national median was lower (IRR\
  \ = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.50-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Bowel resection among hospitalized CD\
  \ patients varies by race, health insurance, and sex. Further mechanistic studies\
  \ are needed to elucidate the social and biological underpinnings of these variations."
