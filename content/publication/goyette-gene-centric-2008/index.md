abstract: Association mapping and candidate gene studies within inflammatory bowel
  diseases (IBD) linkage regions, as well as genome-wide association studies in Crohn's
  disease (CD) have led to the discovery of multiple risk genes, but these explain
  only a fraction of the genetic susceptibility observed in IBD. We have thus been
  pursuing a region on chromosome 3p21-22 showing linkage to CD and ulcerative colitis
  (UC) using a gene-centric association mapping approach. We identified 12 functional
  candidate genes by searching for literature cocitations with relevant keywords and
  for gene expression patterns consistent with immune/intestinal function. We then
  performed an association study composed of a screening phase, where tagging single
  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were evaluated in 1,020 IBD patients, and an independent
  replication phase in 745 IBD patients. These analyses identified and replicated
  significant association with IBD for four SNPs within a 1.2 Mb linkage disequilibrium
  region. We then identified a non-synonymous coding variant (rs3197999, R689C) in
  the macrophage-stimulating 1 (MST1) gene (P-value 3.62 x 10(-6)) that accounts for
  the association signal, and shows association with both CD and UC. MST1 encodes
  macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP), a protein regulating the innate immune responses
  to bacterial ligands. R689C is predicted to interfere with MSP binding to its receptor,
  suggesting a role for this gene in the pathogenesis of IBD.
