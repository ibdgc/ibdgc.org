abstract: Intestinal fungi are an important component of the microbiota, and recent
  studies have unveiled their potential in modulating host immune homeostasis and
  inflammatory disease. Nonetheless, the mechanisms governing immunity to gut fungal
  communities (mycobiota) remain unknown. We identified CX3CR1+ mononuclear phagocytes
  (MNPs) as being essential for the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses
  to intestinal fungi. CX3CR1+ MNPs express antifungal receptors and activate antifungal
  responses in a Syk-dependent manner. Genetic ablation of CX3CR1+ MNPs in mice led
  to changes in gut fungal communities and to severe colitis that was rescued by antifungal
  treatment. In Crohn's disease patients, a missense mutation in the gene encoding
  CX3CR1 was identified and found to be associated with impaired antifungal responses.
  These results unravel a role of CX3CR1+ MNPs in mediating interactions between intestinal
  mycobiota and host immunity at steady state and during inflammatory disease.
