abstract: NK cells are innate immune cells known for their cytolytic activities toward
  tumors and infections. They are capable of expressing diverse killer Ig-like receptors
  (KIRs), and KIRs are implicated in susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic
  intestinal inflammatory disease. However, the cellular mechanism of this genetic
  contribution is unknown. In this study, we show that the \"licensing\" of NK cells,
  determined by the presence of KIR2DL3 and homozygous HLA-C1 in host genome, results
  in their cytokine reprogramming, which permits them to promote CD4(+) T cell activation
  and Th17 differentiation ex vivo. Microfluidic analysis of thousands of NK single
  cells and bulk secretions established that licensed NK cells are more polarized
  to proinflammatory cytokine production than unlicensed NK cells, including production
  of IFN-γ, TNF-α, CCL-5, and MIP-1β. Cytokines produced by licensed NK augmented
  CD4(+) T cell proliferation and IL-17A/IL-22 production. Ab blocking indicated a
  primary role for IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6 in the augmented T cell-proliferative response.
  In conclusion, NK licensing mediated by KIR2DL2/3 and HLA-C1 elicits a novel NK
  cytokine program that activates and induces proinflammatory CD4(+) T cells, thereby
  providing a potential biologic mechanism for KIR-associated susceptibility to CD
  and other chronic inflammatory diseases.
