abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Adherence plays an important role in the therapeutic effectiveness
  of medical therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We assessed whether trust-in-physician
  and Black race were predictors of adherence. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional
  study of Black (n = 120) and White (n = 115) IBD patients recruited from an outpatient
  IBD clinic. Self-reported adherence to taking medication and keeping appointments,
  trust-in-physician, and health-related quality of life were measured using the validated
  instruments, the modified Hill-Bone Compliance Scale (HBCS), the Trust-in-Physician
  Scale (TIPS), and the Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ), respectively. RESULTS: Overall
  adherence was 65%. Higher adherence correlated with greater trust-in-physician (r
  = -0.30; P textless 0.0001), increasing age (r = -0.19; P = 0.01), and worsening
  health-related quality of life (r = -0.18; P = 0.01). Adherence was also higher
  among White IBD patients compared to Blacks (HBSC: 15.6 versus 14.0, P textless
  0.0001). Trust-in-physician, race, and age remained predictors of adherence to medical
  management after adjustment for employment, income, health insurance, marital and
  socioeconomic status, and immunomodulator therapy. The adjusted odds ratio for adherence
  in Blacks compared to Whites was 0.29 (95% confidence interval: 0.13-0.64). Every
  half standard deviation increase in trust-in-physician and every incremental decade
  in age were associated with 36% and 47% higher likelihood of adherence, respectively.
  CONCLUSIONS: Trust-in-physician is a potentially modifiable predictor of adherence
  to IBD medical therapy. Black IBD patients exhibited lower adherence compared to
  their White counterparts. Understanding the mechanisms of these racial differences
  may lead to better optimization of therapeutic effectiveness.'
