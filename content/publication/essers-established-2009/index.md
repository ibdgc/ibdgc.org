abstract: "BACKGROUND: Early-onset disease is frequently examined in genetic studies\
  \ because it is presumed to contain a more severe subset of patients under a higher\
  \ influence of genetic effects. In light of the dramatic success of Crohn's disease\
  \ (CD) gene discovery efforts, we aimed to characterize the contribution of established\
  \ common risk variants to pediatric CD. METHODS: Using 35 confirmed CD  risk alleles,\
  \ we genotyped 384 parent-child trios (mean age of onset 11.7 years)  along with\
  \ 321 healthy controls. We performed association tests on the independent pediatric\
  \ cohort and compared results to those previously published.1 We also computed a\
  \ weighted CD genetic risk score for each affected person. Six variants not previously\
  \ validated in children (at 5q33, 1q24, 7p12, 12q12, 8q24,  and 1q32) were significantly\
  \ associated with pediatric CD (P textless 0.03). RESULTS: We detected no significant\
  \ association between risk score and age at onset through age 30. This analysis\
  \ illustrates that the genetic effect of established CD risk  variants is similar\
  \ in early and later onset CD. CONCLUSIONS: These results motivate joint analyses\
  \ of genome-wide association data in early and late onset cohorts and suggest that,\
  \ rather than established risk variants, independent variants or environmental exposures\
  \ should be sought as modulators of age of onset."
