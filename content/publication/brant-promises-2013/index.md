abstract: Over the past two decades, investigators have used whole genome linkage
  and genome-wide association studies, including the \"Immunochip\" study, to identify
  a surprising number (over 163) of genetic loci containing susceptibility genes for
  inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its 2 major phenotypes, Crohn's disease (CD)
  and ulcerative colitis (UC). These loci, although nearly all low-risk, have provided
  important lessons regarding the nature of IBD etiopathogenesis, including that most
  loci cause both CD and UC risk; one-third of loci have risk for other common autoimmune
  diseases; numerous loci contain genes that regulate immunity to microbes; Th17 cells
  are disproportionately influenced by genes within IBD loci; and the HLA region influences
  UC far greater than CD. Interleukin-10 receptor subunit (IL10RA and IL10RB) and
  IL10 cytokine gene mutations cause a rare, severe, infantile-onset, autosomal recessive
  CD, and this knowledge has allowed curative treatment by bone marrow transplant.
  Key tasks for broader clinical translation include discovery of risk variants for
  non-white populations; discovery of the less frequent but higher penetrance and
  familial risk variants by next-generation sequencing; and determining which of numerous
  associated variations within loci result in specific gene dysfunction causing IBD
  risk-as only a small number of genes within IBD loci, including NOD2, IL23R, ATG16L1,
  IRGM, and PTPN22 have specific functional variations characterized. Studying the
  effect of IBD susceptiblity gene dysfunctions in tissue cultures and animal models
  will allow the ultimate translational benefits of developing novel treatments for
  and potentially preventing IBD in those having specific genetic risk factors.
