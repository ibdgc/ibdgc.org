 abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease is a relapsing and remitting inflammatory disorder with a variable clinical course. Although most patients present with an inflammatory phenotype (B1), approximately 20% of patients rapidly progresses to complicated disease, which includes stricturing (B2) within 5 years. We analyzed DNA methylation patterns in blood samples of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease at diagnosis and later time points to identify changes that associate with and might contribute to disease development and progression.
METHODS: We obtained blood samples from 164 pediatric patients (ages, 1-17 years) with Crohn's disease (B1 or B2) who participated in a North American study and were followed for 5 years. Participants without intestinal inflammation or symptoms were used as controls (n=74). DNA methylation patterns were analyzed at approximately 850,000 sites, in samples collected at time of diagnosis and 1-3 years later. We used genetic association and the concept of Mendelian randomization to identify changes in DNA methylation patterns that might contribute to development of or result from Crohn's disease.
RESULTS: We identified 1189 CpGs that were differentially methylated between patients with Crohn's disease (at diagnosis) and controls. Methylation changes at these sites correlated with plasma levels of C-reactive protein. A comparison of methylation profiles of DNA collected at diagnosis of Crohn's disease vs during the follow-up period revealed that, during treatment, alterations identified in methylation profiles at the time of diagnosis of Crohn's disease more closely resembled patterns observed in controls, irrespective of disease progression to B2. We identified methylation changes at 3 CpGs that might contribute to the development of Crohn's disease. Most CpG methylation changes associated with Crohn's disease disappeared with treatment of inflammation, and might be a result of Crohn's disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Methylation patterns observed in blood samples from patients with Crohn's disease accompany acute inflammation; with treatment, they change to resemble methylation patterns observed in patients without intestinal inflammation. These findings indicate that Crohn's disease-associated patterns of DNA methylation observed in blood samples are a result of the inflammatory features of the disease and are less likely to contribute to disease development or progression.},
