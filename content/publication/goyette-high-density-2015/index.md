abstract: Genome-wide association studies of the related chronic inflammatory bowel
  diseases (IBD) known as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have shown strong
  evidence of association to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This region
  encodes a large number of immunological candidates, including the antigen-presenting
  classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. Studies in IBD have indicated
  that multiple independent associations exist at HLA and non-HLA genes, but they
  have lacked the statistical power to define the architecture of association and
  causal alleles. To address this, we performed high-density SNP typing of the MHC
  in textgreater32,000 individuals with IBD, implicating multiple HLA alleles, with
  a primary role for HLA-DRB1*01:03 in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
  Noteworthy differences were observed between these diseases, including a predominant
  role for class II HLA variants and heterozygous advantage observed in ulcerative
  colitis, suggesting an important role of the adaptive immune response in the colonic
  environment in the pathogenesis of IBD.
