abstract: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are complex, multifactorial disorders
  that comprise Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Genome-wide association
  studies have identified approximately 100 loci that are significantly associated
  with IBD. These loci implicate a diverse array of genes and pathophysiologic mechanisms,
  including microbe recognition, lymphocyte activation, cytokine signaling, and intestinal
  epithelial defense. Consistent with epidemiologic predictions, many IBD-associated
  loci demonstrate genome-wide significant associations to both CD and UC, notably,
  genes whose products function in the interleukin-23 pathway, and transcription factors,
  including NK2 transcription factor related, locus 3 (NKX2-3), SMAD3, STAT3, ZMIZ1,
  and c-REL. Although CD and UC are both associated with genomic regions that implicate
  products of genes involved in leukocyte trafficking, there is evidence for association
  patterns that are distinct between CD and UC. CD-predominant associations include
  NOD2 and genes that regulate autophagy. In UC, the predominant association signal
  is on chromosome 6p21, in the major histocompatibility complex region, near HLA
  class II genes. UC-predominant loci have also implicated genes mediating epithelial
  defense function. There is a striking overlap of loci between diseases, which could
  provide comparative insight into mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. Genes that
  encode factors that function in the interleukin-23 pathway have been associated
  with a number of chronic inflammatory diseases, notably psoriasis and ankylosing
  spondylitis. Distinct genetic associations indicate that the colitis associated
  with primary sclerosing cholangitis is pathophysiologically distinct from UC that
  is not associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis. As many as 14 susceptibility
  loci are shared between IBD and celiac disease, indicating significant overlap in
  pathophysiology. Future genetic studies will be directed toward identifying uncommon
  variations with potentially greater statistical effects, defining population differences,
  and more completely accounting for familial transmission of disease.
