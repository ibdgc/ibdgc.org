Dr. Yuan is a Professor of Computational Biology, and hist research is focused on systems-level cell-state characterization and gene regulation. He has served as a PI or MPI on HuBMAP and several other NIH funded projects which aim at creating high-resolution spatially-resolved cell atlas. He was charged to develop innovative methods for analyzing spatial transcriptomic data. Specifically, his team developed a hidden Markov random field model to identify spatial domains, a weighted least square regression model for cell-type deconvolution, a computationally efficient model for spatial gene detection.
