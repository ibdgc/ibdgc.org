abstract: "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Genetic susceptibility loci for Crohn's disease (CD)\
  \ are numerous, complex, and likely interact with undefined components of the environment.\
  \ It has been a challenge to link the effects of particular loci to phenotypes of\
  \ cells associated with pathogenesis of CD, such as Paneth cells. We investigated\
  \ whether specific phenotypes of Paneth cells associated with particular genetic\
  \ susceptibility loci can be used to define specific subtypes of CD. METHODS: We\
  \ performed a retrospective analysis of 119 resection specimens collected from patients\
  \ with CD at 2 separate medical centers. Paneth cell phenotypes were classified\
  \ as normal or abnormal (with disordered, diminished, diffuse, or excluded granule\
  \ phenotypes) based on lysozyme-positive secretory granule morphology. To uncover\
  \ the molecular basis of the Paneth cell phenotypes, we developed methods to determine\
  \ transcriptional profiles from whole-thickness and laser-capture microdissected,\
  \ formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. RESULTS: The proportion of\
  \ abnormal Paneth cells was associated with the number of CD-associated NOD2 risk\
  \ alleles. The cumulative number of NOD2 and ATG16L1 risk alleles had an additive\
  \ effect on the proportion of abnormal Paneth cells. Unsupervised clustering analysis\
  \ of demographic and Paneth cell data divided patients into 2 principal subgroups,\
  \ defined by high and low proportions of abnormal Paneth cells. The disordered and\
  \ diffuse abnormal Paneth cell phenotypes were associated with an altered transcriptional\
  \ signature of immune system activation. We observed an inverse correlation between\
  \ abnormal Paneth cells and presence of granuloma. In addition, high proportions\
  \ of abnormal Paneth cells were associated with shorter time to disease recurrence\
  \ after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Histologic analysis of Paneth cell phenotypes can\
  \ be used to divide patients with CD into subgroups with distinct pathognomonic\
  \ and clinical features."
