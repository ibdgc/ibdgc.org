 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, such as infliximab (IFX), have been increasingly used to induce and maintain disease remission in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Despite a considerable non-response rate, little is known about the genetic predictors of response to anti-TNF therapy in CD. Our aim in this study was to investigate the genetic factors associated with response to anti-TNF therapy in patients with CD.
METHODS: We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify loci influencing the response to IFX among Korean patients with CD, comprising 42 good responders with mucosal healing and 70 non-responders. The achievement of mucosal healing was assessed by endoscopy and imaging. The functional significance of TRAP1 (TNF receptor associated protein 1) was examined using dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis model in TRAP1 transgenic mice.
RESULTS: The GWAS identified rs2158962, an intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of TRAP1, significantly associated with mucosal healing (odds ratio = 4.94; Pcombined  = 1.35 × 10-7 ). In the dextran sodium sulfate-induced acute colitis, TRAP1 transgenic mice showed a better response to IFX than the wild-type mice.
CONCLUSIONS: The TRAP1 gene is associated with mucosal healing in CD patients following IFX therapy. Identifying the genetic predictors of mucosal healing to anti-TNF therapy can prevent patients from exposure to ineffective therapies.},
