abstract: "BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated that morphologic defects of ileal\
  \ Paneth cells correlate with multiple susceptible genetic variants, the presence\
  \ of granuloma, and clinical outcome in Crohn's disease. These studies were performed\
  \ using uninvolved areas of resection specimens. To develop Paneth cell phenotype\
  \ as a prognostic biomarker in Crohn's disease, further characterization is necessary.\
  \ Specifically, effects of disease activity, phenotype duration, and the minimal\
  \ crypt number that would allow for accurate Paneth cell phenotyping are unknown.\
  \ METHODS: We compared Paneth cell phenotypes in (1) 46 cases with paired involved\
  \ and uninvolved sections; (2) 36 cases with multiple ileal resections over time;\
  \ (3) \\\"virtual biopsies\\\" by randomly selecting 10 to 60 crypts from 85 surgical\
  \ cases where 250 crypts had been analyzed; and (4) 26 cases with resection and\
  \ biopsy performed within 1 year. RESULTS: In paired resection specimens, the Paneth\
  \ cell phenotypes in the uninvolved areas correlated with those seen in involved\
  \ areas (P textless 0.0001) and also predicted the presence of granuloma (P = 0.042).\
  \ Importantly, the Paneth cell phenotype remained stable over time (P textless 0.0001).\
  \ By mathematical analyses, a minimum of 40 crypts was required to generate results\
  \ equivalent to those using resection specimens. Finally, there was good correlation\
  \ in Paneth cell phenotypes in biopsy specimens and resection specimens obtained\
  \ within 1 year (P = 0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: Accurate Paneth cell phenotypes can be\
  \ assessed using biopsy materials with the caveat that sufficient well-oriented\
  \ crypts exist in the specimen. This advance will extend the potential clinical\
  \ application of this novel stratification platform."
