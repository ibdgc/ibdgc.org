abstract: Genome-wide association studies as well as murine models have shown that
  the interleukin 23 receptor (IL23R) pathway plays a pivotal role in chronic inflammatory
  diseases such as Crohn disease (CD), ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, and type 1 diabetes.
  Genome-wide association studies and targeted re-sequencing studies have revealed
  the presence of multiple potentially causal variants of the IL23R. Specifically
  the G149R, V362I, and R381Q IL23Rα chain variants are linked to protection against
  the development of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis in humans. Moreover, the
  exact mechanism of action of these receptor variants has not been elucidated. We
  show that all three of these IL23Rα variants cause a reduction in IL23 receptor
  activation-mediated phosphorylation of the signal-transducing activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3) and phosphorylation of signal transducing activator of transcription 4
  (STAT4). The reduction in signaling is due to lower levels of cell surface receptor
  expression. For G149R, the receptor retention in the endoplasmic reticulum is due
  to an impairment of receptor maturation, whereas the R381Q and V362I variants have
  reduced protein stability. Finally, we demonstrate that the endogenous expression
  of IL23Rα protein from V362I and R381Q variants in human lymphoblastoid cell lines
  exhibited lower expression levels relative to susceptibility alleles. Our results
  suggest a convergent cause of IL23Rα variant protection against chronic inflammatory
  disease.
