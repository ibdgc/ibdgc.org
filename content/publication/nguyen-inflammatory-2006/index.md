abstract: "OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising primarily of Crohn's\
  \ disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is increasingly prevalent in racial\
  \ and ethnic minorities. This study was undertaken to characterize racial differences\
  \ in disease phenotype in a predominantly adult population. METHODS: Phenotype data\
  \ on 830 non-Hispanic white, 127 non-Hispanic African American, and 169 Hispanic\
  \ IBD patients, recruited from six academic centers, were abstracted from medical\
  \ records and compiled in the NIDDK-IBD Genetics Consortium repository. We characterized\
  \ racial differences in family history, disease location and behavior, surgical\
  \ history, and extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) using standardized definitions.\
  \ RESULTS: African American CD patients were more likely  than whites to develop\
  \ esophagogastroduodenal CD (OR = 2.8; 95% CI: 1.4-5.5), colorectal disease (OR\
  \ = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.1-3.4), perianal disease (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.03-2.8), but less\
  \ likely to have ileal involvement (OR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.32-0.96). They were also\
  \ at higher risk for uveitis (OR = 5.5; 95% CI: 2.3-13.0) and sacroiliitis (OR =\
  \ 4.0; 95% CI: 1.55-10.1). Hispanics had higher prevalence of perianal CD (OR =\
  \ 2.9; 95% CI: 1.8-4.6) and erythema nodosum (3.3;  95% CI: 1.7-6.4). Among UC patients,\
  \ Hispanics had more proximal disease extent.  Both African American and Hispanic\
  \ CD patients, but not UC patients, had lower prevalences of family history of IBD\
  \ than their white counterparts. CONCLUSIONS:  There are racial differences in IBD\
  \ family history, disease location, and EIMs that may reflect underlying genetic\
  \ variations and have important implications for diagnosis and management of disease.\
  \ These findings underscore the need for further studies in minority populations."
