abstract: Following recent success in genome-wide association studies, a critical
  focus of human genetics is to understand how genetic variation at implicated loci
  influences cellular and disease processes. Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with
  SNPs around IRGM, but coding-sequence variation has been excluded as a source of
  this association. We identified a common, 20-kb deletion polymorphism, immediately
  upstream of IRGM and in perfect linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 1.0) with the most
  strongly CD-associated SNP, that causes IRGM to segregate in the population with
  two distinct upstream sequences. The deletion (CD risk) and reference (CD protective)
  haplotypes of IRGM showed distinct expression patterns. Manipulation of IRGM expression
  levels modulated cellular autophagy of internalized bacteria, a process implicated
  in CD. These results suggest that the CD association at IRGM arises from an alteration
  in IRGM regulation that affects the efficacy of autophagy and identify a common
  deletion polymorphism as a likely causal variant.
