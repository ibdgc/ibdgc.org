abstract: "Background: Age of onset is linked to variations in clinical phenotypes\
  \ and natural history in Crohn's disease (CD). We aim to define etiologically more\
  \ homogenous subgroups in CD based on ages of onset. Methods: We examined the distribution\
  \ of CD polygenetic risk score (PRS) across ages of diagnosis in a Caucasian cohort\
  \ of 2344 independent CD patients. We identified subgroups with a distinct distribution\
  \ of PRS and compared those groups in genetics, demographic characteristics, clinical\
  \ subphenotypes, and serological markers. The results were replicated in an independent\
  \ cohort of 13,065 CD patients from the International Inflammatory Bowel Diseases\
  \ Genetic Consortium (IIBDGC). Results: We identified a late-onset (LO) subgroup\
  \ in CD (age at diagnosis â‰¥ 55 years) with significantly lower PRS compared with\
  \ the intermediate group (age at diagnosis between 5 and 55 years) in both cohorts.\
  \ Smoking cessation, a risk factor for ulcerative colitis (UC) and protective factor\
  \ for CD, had a higher rate in this LO subgroup in comparison with the intermediate\
  \ group. We also compared the LO group with the intermediate group, and, consistent\
  \ with previous reports, the LO group more often had colonic CD, had less penetrating\
  \ disease behavior, and had less need for surgery. Serological analysis showed that\
  \ LO CD patients were more antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positive and less\
  \ antisaccharomyces cerevisiae antibody positive compared with the intermediate\
  \ group. Variance component analysis indicated that overall genetic contribution\
  \ to LO CD was lower relative to the middle group, and genetic heterogeneity testing\
  \ indicated that LO CD was different from the middle group in underlying genetic\
  \ architecture. Conclusions: Late-onset CD is subgroup distinct in genetic and behavioral\
  \ risk factors with UC-like characteristics. 10.1093/ibd/izy148_video1izy148.video15791413461001."
