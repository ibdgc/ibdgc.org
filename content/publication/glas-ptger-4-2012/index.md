abstract: "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies identified a PTGER4 expression-modulating\
  \ region on chromosome 5p13.1 as Crohn's disease (CD) susceptibility region. The\
  \ study aim was to test this association in a large cohort of patients with inflammatory\
  \ bowel disease (IBD) and to elucidate genotypic and phenotypic interactions with\
  \ other IBD genes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 7073 patients and\
  \ controls were genotyped: 844 CD and 471 patients with ulcerative colitis and 1488\
  \ controls were analyzed for the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs4495224\
  \ and rs7720838 on chromosome 5p13.1. The study included two replication cohorts\
  \ of North American (CD: n = 684; controls:  n = 1440) and of German origin (CD:\
  \ n = 1098; controls: n = 1048). Genotype-phenotype, epistasis and transcription\
  \ factor binding analyses were performed. In the discovery cohort, an association\
  \ of rs4495224 (p = 4.10x10(-)(5); 0.76 [0.67-0.87]) and of rs7720838 (p = 6.91x10(-)(4);\
  \ 0.81 [0.71-0.91]) with susceptibility to CD was demonstrated. These associations\
  \ were  confirmed in both replication cohorts. In silico analysis predicted rs4495224\
  \ and rs7720838 as essential parts of binding sites for the transcription factors"
