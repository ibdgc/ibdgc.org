abstract: 'Abstract  Background and Aims Crohn’s disease (CD) recurrence following
  ileocolic resection (ICR) is common. We sought to identify blood-based biomarkers
  associated with CD recurrence.   Methods CD patients undergoing ICR were recruited
  across six centres. Serum samples were obtained at post-operative colonoscopy. A
  multiplex immunoassay was used to analyse 92 inflammation-related proteins (Olink
  Proteomics). Bayesian analysis was used to identify proteins associated with increasing
  Rutgeerts score. Identified proteins were employed in receiver operating characteristic
  (ROC) analysis to examine ability to identify CD recurrence (Rutgeerts score ≥ i2).
  Existing single cell data was interrogated to further elucidate the role of identified
  proteins.   Results Data from 276 colonoscopies in 213 patients were available.
  Median time from surgery to 1st and 2nd colonoscopy was 7 (IQR 6-9) and 19 (IQR
  16-23) months, respectively. Disease recurrence was evident at 60 (30%) first and
  36 (49%) second colonoscopies. Of 14 proteins significantly associated with Rutgeerts
  score, the strongest signal was seen for CXCL9 and MMP1. Among patients on anti-TNF,
  CXCL9 and CXCL11 were most strongly associated with Rutgeerts score. Both are CXCR3
  ligands. Incorporation of identified proteins into ROC analysis improved the ability
  to identify disease recurrence as compared to C-reactive protein alone; area under
  the curve (AUC) 0.75 (95% CI: 0.66-0.82) vs. 0.64 (95% CI 0.56-0.72), p=0.012. Single
  cell transcriptomic data provide evidence that innate immune cells are the primary
  source of identified proteins.   Conclusions CXCR3 ligands are associated with CD
  recurrence following ICR. Incorporation of novel blood-based candidate biomarkers
  may aid identification of CD recurrence.'
