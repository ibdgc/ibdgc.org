abstract: 'Genome-wide association studies have identified over 200 genomic loci associated
  with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). High-effect risk alleles define key roles
  for genes involved in bacterial response and innate defense. More high-throughput
  in vivo systems are required to rapidly evaluate therapeutic agents. We visualize,
  in zebrafish, the effects on epithelial barrier function and intestinal autophagy
  of one-course and repetitive injury. Repetitive injury induces increased mortality,
  impaired recovery of intestinal barrier function, failure to contain bacteria within
  the intestine and impaired autophagy. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) administration protected
  against injury by enhancing epithelial barrier function and limiting systemic infection.
  Effects of IBD therapeutic agents were defined: mesalamine showed protective features
  during injury, whereas 6-mercaptopurine displayed marked induction of autophagy
  during recovery. Given the highly conserved nature of innate defense in zebrafish,
  it represents an ideal model system with which to test established and new IBD therapies
  targeted to the epithelial barrier.This article has an associated First Person interview
  with the first author of the paper.'
