abstract: The immunopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been attributed
  to a combination of host genetics and intestinal dysbiosis. Previous work in a small
  cohort of IBD patients suggested that pro-inflammatory bacterial taxa are highly
  coated with secretory immunoglobulin IgA. Using bacterial fluorescence-activated
  cell sorting coupled with 16S rRNA gene sequencing (IgA-SEQ), we profiled IgA coating
  of intestinal microbiota in a large cohort of IBD patients and identified bacteria
  associated with disease and treatment. Forty-three bacterial taxa displayed significantly
  higher IgA coating in IBD compared with controls, including 8 taxa exhibiting differential
  IgA coating but similar relative abundance. Patients treated with anti-TNF-α therapies
  exhibited dramatically altered microbiota-specific IgA responses compared with controls.
  Furthermore, increased IgA coating of Oscillospira was associated with a delay in
  time to surgery. These results demonstrate that investigating IgA responses to microbiota
  can uncover potential disease-modifying taxa and reveal improved biomarkers of clinical
  course in IBD.
