We are currently recruiting for a multi-center Crohn’s Disease study. The purpose of this study is to gain further understanding of the mechanisms involved in the recurrence of inflammation following ileal resection surgery for Crohn’s disease (CD). One of the most common locations of CD involvement is the end of the small intestine (ileum), up to 70% of CD patients require surgical resections due to disease at this location. Such surgical management is often a temporary solution as more than 50% of these patients experience recurrence of inflammation one year post surgery, and 90% at five to 10 years following surgery. Reasons for this recurrence remain unknown, however it is believed to be caused by an interaction of genetic, immune and microbial features.

We are conducting analyses on blood, surgical tissue, stool and intestinal biopsy. Studying the IBD specific inflammation, which is localized to the intestine, will lead to a better understanding of the pathways important for intestinal immune system regulation. The complexity of IBD is based on the working belief that gastrointestinal inflammation is a result of an unregulated response of the immune system to intestinal bacteria, which we will be able to study with biopsies and stool. Information gained from this study will be used to build a predictive model to identify those patients at greater risk of rapid recurrence, and will aid physicians in tailoring follow-up treatments.

If you are scheduled to undergo or recently underwent an ileal resection surgery for treatment of CD, and are interested in participating in this study, contact the IBDGC Genetic Research Center (GRC) closest to you.

If you are a clinician and would like to participate as an affiliate recruitment center please contact Ksenija Sabic.
