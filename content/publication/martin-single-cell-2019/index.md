abstract: Clinical benefits of cytokine blockade in ileal Crohn's disease (iCD) are
  limited to a subset of patients. Here, we applied single-cell technologies to iCD
  lesions to address whether cellular heterogeneity contributes to treatment resistance.
  We found that a subset of patients expressed a unique cellular module in inflamed
  tissues that consisted of IgG plasma cells, inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes,
  activated T cells, and stromal cells, which we named the GIMATS module. Analysis
  of ligand-receptor interaction pairs identified a distinct network connectivity
  that likely drives the GIMATS module. Strikingly, the GIMATS module was also present
  in a subset of patients in four independent iCD cohorts (n = 441), and its presence
  at diagnosis correlated with failure to achieve durable corticosteroid-free remission
  upon anti-TNF therapy. These results emphasize the limitations of current diagnostic
  assays and the potential for single-cell mapping tools to identify novel biomarkers
  of treatment response and tailored therapeutic opportunities.
