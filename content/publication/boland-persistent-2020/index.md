abstract: "BACKGROUND & AIMS: In patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs),\
  \ symptoms do not always associate with the severity of endoscopic inflammation\
  \ and can persist after mucosal healing. We investigated whether symptoms in patients\
  \ with successfully treated IBD are related to the composition of the intestinal\
  \ microbiome. METHODS: We analyzed 590 tissue biopsy specimens from 215 patients\
  \ with IBD and 48 healthy individuals (controls). We obtained mucosal biopsy specimens\
  \ from 2 colon sites (ascending and rectosigmoid) and from the terminal ileum along\
  \ with clinical data. Bacterial DNA was extracted from the biopsy specimens and\
  \ the V4 region of 16s ribosomal RNA sequenced by Miseq and processed using the\
  \ QIIME v1.9 pipeline. RESULTS: Mucosal biopsy specimens from patients with Crohn's\
  \ disease (CD) who achieved mucosal healing (Mayo scores of 0-1 or segmental endoscopic\
  \ severity CD scores of 0-5) had lower Chao1 diversity than biopsy specimens from\
  \ patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) or unclassified IBD (IBD-U), or controls.\
  \ After endoscopic evidence of improvement in patients with UC or IBD-U, diversity\
  \ of the tissue-associated microbiota did not differ significantly from that of\
  \ controls. Colon biopsy specimens from patients with CD had lower microbial diversity,\
  \ before and after healing (segmental endoscopic severity CD scores, 0-2), than\
  \ colon biopsy specimens from controls (P textless .002). In patients with CD who\
  \ achieved mucosal healing, residual clinical activity (CD activity index scores\
  \ textgreater150; P = .03) and persistent diarrhea were associated with reduced\
  \ microbial diversity (P = .01). Continued diarrhea was associated with a trend\
  \ toward dysbiosis, based on the microbial dysbiosis index (P = .059). In patients\
  \ with UC or IBD-U with moderate to severe inflammation, increasing severity of\
  \ diarrhea was associated with reduced microbial diversity (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS:\
  \ In an analysis of biopsy specimens from patients with IBD and controls, we found\
  \ that despite endoscopic evidence of improvement or remission, α-diversity of the\
  \ tissue-associated intestinal microbiome remained lower in patients with CD than\
  \ in controls. This observation, along with the reduced Chao1 diversity and greater\
  \ dysbiosis in intestinal microbiota of patients with residual symptoms of IBD,\
  \ indicates that microbiome composition could be associated with persistent diarrhea."
