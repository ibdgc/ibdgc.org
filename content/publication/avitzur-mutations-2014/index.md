abstract: 'BACKGROUND & AIMS: Very early onset inflammatory bowel diseases (VEOIBD),
  including infant disorders, are a diverse group of diseases found in children younger
  than 6 years of age. They have been associated with several gene variants. Our aim
  was to identify the genes that cause VEOIBD. METHODS: We performed whole exome sequencing
  of DNA from 1 infant with severe enterocolitis and her parents. Candidate gene mutations
  were validated in 40 pediatric patients and functional studies were carried out
  using intestinal samples and human intestinal cell lines. RESULTS: We identified
  compound heterozygote mutations in the Tetratricopeptide repeat domain 7 (TTC7A)
  gene in an infant from non-consanguineous parents with severe exfoliative apoptotic
  enterocolitis; we also detected TTC7A mutations in 2 unrelated families, each with
  2 affected siblings. TTC7A interacts with EFR3 homolog B to regulate phosphatidylinositol
  4-kinase at the plasma membrane. Functional studies demonstrated that TTC7A is expressed
  in human enterocytes. The mutations we identified in TTC7A result in either mislocalization
  or reduced expression of TTC7A. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase was found to co-immunoprecipitate
  with TTC7A; the identified TTC7A mutations reduced this binding. Knockdown of TTC7A
  in human intestinal-like cell lines reduced their adhesion, increased apoptosis,
  and decreased production of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. CONCLUSIONS: In a
  genetic analysis, we identified loss of function mutations in TTC7A in 5 infants
  with VEOIBD. Functional studies demonstrated that the mutations cause defects in
  enterocytes and T cells that lead to severe apoptotic enterocolitis. Defects in
  the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase-TTC7A-EFR3 homolog B pathway are involved in the
  pathogenesis of VEOIBD.'
