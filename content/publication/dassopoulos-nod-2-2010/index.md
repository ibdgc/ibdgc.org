abstract: "OBJECTIVES: NOD2 mutations and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies\
  \ (ASCAs) are established risk factors of Crohn's disease (CD) in whites but have\
  \ not been assessed in African-American (AA) adults with CD. METHODS: AAs with CD\
  \ and controls were recruited by the Mid-Atlantic African-American IBD Study as\
  \ part of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)\
  \ IBD Genetics Consortium. Genotyping for the three common CD NOD2 mutations (Leu1007fsinsC,\
  \ G908R/2722gtextgreaterc, and R702W/2104ctextgreatert) and ASCA enzyme-linked immunosorbent\
  \ assays were performed in 183 AA CD patients and in 143 controls. Logistic regression\
  \ was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the association between ASCA\
  \ and disease phenotype. RESULTS: ASCA sensitivity and specificity values were 70.5\
  \ and 70.4%, respectively. On univariate analysis, ASCA was significantly associated\
  \ with younger age at diagnosis, ileal involvement, and complicated (stricturing/penetrating)\
  \ behavior. On multivariate analysis, ASCA titer (per 25 Units) was associated with\
  \ ileal involvement (OR 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-1.34), complicated\
  \ behavior (OR 1.13, 95% CI: 1.01-1.28), and surgery (hazard ratio: 1.11, 95% CI:\
  \ 1.02-1.21). Cigarette smoking and CD family history were also significantly associated\
  \ with surgery. NOD2 carriers (all heterozygotes) were more common among CD cases\
  \ than controls (8.2 vs. 2.1%; OR 4.17%, 95% CI: 1.18-14.69). The NOD2 mutation\
  \ population attributable risk was 6.2%. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with whites,\
  \ ASCA in AAs has a similar sensitivity but a lower specificity for CD. ASCA is\
  \ associated with ileal involvement, complicated behavior, and surgery in AAs with\
  \ CD. NOD2 is a risk gene for AA CD, although mutation frequency and population\
  \ attributable risk are much lower than in whites."
